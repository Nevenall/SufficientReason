## Questions & Answers

  1. What was your awakening like? 
      - Great Horned Ram level initiation into Masonic Lodge - been a mason since joining being invited by a fraternity brother while in MBA program at ASU. Having already 'drunk the koolaid' he was neither too surprised nor overwhelmed by what came from the awakening, though somewhat shocked by the depth/breadth of the powers involved in being an awakened one.
  2. Who was the first to find you and teach you about Magick?
      - My Mentor was the high Elk Priest of the Phoenix area Masonic Lodge. He provided not only an initiation into how to use powers, but educated me about the way things are, and how to behave/manifest these powers in a way befitting to the responsibilities of my position in society.
  3. Do you still have a relationship with them?
      - we chat every now and then...
  4. Do you know any other Mages in SF?
      - Have a casual membership with SF Masonic lodge. Am known and recocknized for my rank, and am aware of other mages in the order (its not all mages you know, just at the higher levels)
  5. How much do you know about other Mages?
      - Some, but only from a specific perspective.
  6. How much do you know about the Reality War? 
      - Some. The Masons represent a more traditional approach to the management of sleepers - and while not opposed to the underlying premises of the technocracy (ie that sleepers are so much livestock to be managed, and that real power over the world is currently up in the air and worth fighting for), we are not entirely fond of their methods, their elitism, nor their disdain for tradition.
  7. How much are you involved in the Reality War?
      - How can a responsible and informed person not be involved? Our very way of life, the order of things and the mainenance of those conditions which have kept a dubious but continuous balance of power across the entire planet for millenia stretching back to the days of pharoahs are at stake.
  8. Why are you in San Francisco right now?
      - Nominally: transferred/promoted to Regional VP of Operations at Pfizer (we all know regional VP's don't actually do anything but ride around in planes and talk to people). Actually - to qualify for the next level of initiation I must bring down or foil some significant technocratic plot/plan or otherwise significantly improve the situation of The Order in Geopolitics. SF seemed like a good place to put myself to get a sense of the fomenting plans of the Silicon Beast.
