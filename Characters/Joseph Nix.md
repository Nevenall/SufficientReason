## Distinctions

  * Tradition: Akashayana
  * "Hold the Middle Way" (aka "Perfectionism") - Nix often gets too focused on "getting it right" and gets stuck, resisting what is or what he wants.  Sometimes he finds the balance but more often it is a series of personal struggles against perfectionism.
  * "Entranced by Inaction" (aka "Procrastination") - Nix claims to get drawn too far into the formless and seduced by emptiness and inaction.  Most people call it procrastination.
  * Dojo Member - Nix does most of his learning and teaching at a nondescript (strangely generic) dojo/meditation center.  He isn't the most charismatic teacher there, but other than the head instructor, Mifune (his mentor), he's the clearly the most advanced practitioner.

# Questions & Answers

1.	What was your awakening like?  
    - Nix was on a solo weekend meditation retreat on a personal quest for deeper levels of asceticism (but lets keep it in perspective, he’s a white dude from San Francisco).  He was in some distress from recently breaking up with his long-term girlfriend (she kept disrupting his “Zen”).  Somehow, despite his self-absorption and half-assed idea of “emptiness”, he found his way into his Demesne and a local spirit led him to the astral seat of the Akashic Brotherhood.  
2.	Who was the first to find you and teach you about Magick?
    - When he came out of his trance, he “found” his way to a local dojo and met a low-ranking Akashic Brother who took him on as a student.
3.	Do you still have a relationship with them?  
    - Yes, but now Nix helps teach at the Dojo too
4.	Do you know any other Mages in SF?  
    - No one else yet, he’s pretty self absorbed right now.
5.	How much do you know about other Mages?  
    - Very little.
6.	How much do you know about the Reality War?
    - It exists.  He knows about the reality war to the same degree most Americans know about the war in Afghanistan.
7.	How much are you involved in the Reality War?  
    - Distracted spectator.
8.	Why are you in San Francisco right now?  
    - That’s where Nix grew up and where the dojo is.
