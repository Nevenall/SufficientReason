# Welcome to Reality

Reality is what people believe it is.  

I say that and I see you nodding your head but trust me. You don't get it. You don't feel it. You don't believe it.  

Reality...everything...everything that is possible or impossible is nothing. Nothing but what our beliefs make it. The laws of physics are just a belief most people haven't examined and there's a lot more like that.  

There are reasons most people don't look hard at what they really believe, and not just the reasons you'd think.  

I'm talking to you because you are special.  

There is power in you and that makes your beliefs powerful and that means what you believe can reshape reality.  

Do you ever fly in your dreams? Or maybe move things with your mind? Remember that feeling that comes right before you start floating off the ground? That feeling of decision...that Will to ignore your supposed limitations? If you are still and quiet you can feel that same feeling when you are awake can't you? We call that Magick.  

There are other creatures with power out there and you should watch out for them, but always remember they can only do specific things. Their power is as bound by it's own reality as most people are by physics.  

Reasons? I don't know why this power is in you. I don't know why you are special and not your brother. There's a lot of theories about that, but I do know why reality is the bitch she is.  

Let me tell you. This power is rare. Most people don't have it and we call them Sleepers. But, think how many more of them there are then there are of us. I know maybe fifty Mages like you and me. There may be no more than ten thousand left in the whole world. No one is sure. Numbers matter in belief just like they do in war.  

Funny I should mention war. You see, us Mages accept a diversity of beliefs about what we do and how it works. Some believe they are doing divine will on earth, some believe that reality is a computer simulation and they can hack the code. Crazy stuff. But, there are people out there who understand the true nature of reality and want it to be exactly one way. Their way.  

They're called the Technocracy and they invented physics, science, TV, global economies and all that and they disseminated it to the Sleepers. They got enough people to believe it that â€“ well, I don't have to tell you what a shit-show reality is.  

They started a war for reality and we are the only ones who even know there is something to fight for. I heard they call us Reality Deviants and hunt us down. If they can find us. Which is why you shouldn't conjure a forest in the subway.
