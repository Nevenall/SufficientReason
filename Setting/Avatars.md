# Avatars 

  As a Mage there is something different about you. You have a spiritual guide, some call it an over-soul, a spark of divinity, a guardian angel, a loa, a genius, a powerful past life, or even a familiar. This is your Avatar and it came to you one dark night to led you towards answers you didn't have the words to ask for. It showed you that your beliefs have the power change reality. It showed you how to make Magick.

  Depending on the circumstances, Avatars can be subtle nudges and intuitions, a spiritual dissatisfaction, or a fully embodied presence dispensing obscure wisdom. Regardless of their form, avatars have a distinct nature, or personality, which can shape a mage in a similar way, or be something they are constantly fighting. 

## Dynamic 

  Dynamic avatars personify change and will push, prod, drag, and even trick Mages into seeking the new. Dynamic doesn't always mean restless and wild, in fact few can concentrate more intensely then a Dynamic mage overtaken by a passion. This is an avatar of change, and change manifests new things. 

## Pattern 

  Avatars of Pattern place value on caution, reason, and stability. They may sometimes be claustrophobic and resistant to even the most positive of change, but they are also solid and ever sound fortresses.  

## Primordial 

  Less human and more cosmic, the primordial avatar is a shadow that lingers in your peripheral vision. A pool of dark water. A mystery. A horror.  

## Questing 

  This avatar is a yearning that comes from a deep place. It's not a constant need to burn and change, but a more human need to adventure and explore and be part of the next story.
