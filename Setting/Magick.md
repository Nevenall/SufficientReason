 # Magick

  Reality may seem like a solid wall to bounce your head against, but it's true nature is far more malleable then that. There are some few people who've awakened to this and with their Will can affect changes in reality. We call this *Magick*. 

  ## Spheres

  Mysticks traditionally parcel all of reality into nine *spheres* to facilitate their studies. Each sphere represents your understanding of some facet of reality and your ability to manipulate it.  

  Correspondence
  ~ space, places, and relations between things
  ~ the distance, real or metaphorical, between you and the target of your spell is a correspondence effect
  ~ Conjuration, Scrying, Gates, Warding, Teleportation


  Entropy
  ~ decay, chaos, and probability

  Forces
  ~ elemental energies: fire, ice, gravity
  
  Life
  ~ things that live

  Matter
  ~ things that do not live

  Mind
  ~ sapience 

  Prime
  ~ primordial energies of reality
  ~ how long your spell will last is an effect of Prime.

  Spirit
  ~ Other worlds and their entities. 

  Time
  ~ Perception and flow of temporal reality.
