# Making a Mage

## Concept

  *Describe who your Mage is in five words or so.*

  You may have lived as a mystick most of your life, or you might be a barely woken innocent. What are the fundamental elements of you?

## Avatar

  *Pick a type (Dynamic, Pattern, Primordial, or Questing) and characterize your avatar a bit.*

  *Avatar 1 costs 0d6, Avatar 2 costs 1d6, 3 costs 2d6, 4 costs 4d6, 5 costs 8d6, 6 costs 16d6*

  There is something different about you. You have a spiritual guide. Some call it an over-soul, a spark of divinity, a guardian angel, a loa, a genius, or even a familiar. This is your Avatar and it came to you one dark night to led you towards answers you didn't have the words to ask for. It showed you that your beliefs have the power change reality. It showed you how to make Magick.

  For some mages their Avatar is a subtle nudge or intuition, for other's it's a fully embodied entity.

  Avatar is a mystickal rating of how much personal Quintessence you can hold and how much, from any source, you can spend on a single magickal action.

## Focus

  *Pick a Paradigm, at least one Magickal practice, and 7 Instruments.*

  What does the mage believe? = paradigm

  How does the mage turn belief into action? = practice

  What does the mage use in that practice? = instruments

  All combined = focus.

## Attributes

  *Assign d6, d8, d10 to the three Attributes: Physical, Mental, Social.*

  Attributes are mundane traits that represent general faculties.

  They are the base of most any action.

## Distinctions

  *Pick a Tradition and 3 more.*

  Distinctions are mundane traits that can help or hinder a Mage's actions. They can be relationships, affiliations, personality, or unique backgrounds.

  An appropriate Distinction can be helpful as a d8, or a detriment as a d4 and you get a Plot Point. Helpful or Hurtful is your choice.

## Skills

  *All skills start at 'Untrained' d4. Spend Character Dice to advance them up to 'Master' d12.*

  Skills are mundane traits that represent distinct areas of expertise and training.


  Skill              | Description
  ------------------:|:-------
    **Academics**    | Any mundane areas of knowledge.
    **Art**          | Creating art and expressing a truth through it.
    **Athletics**    | Running, swimming, catching, throwing, acrobatics.
    **Cosmology**    | Knowledge of other worlds, dimensions, planes of being; their inhabitants, and how to navigate them.
    **Craft**        | Build and repair things.
    **Drive**        | Drive various vehicles.
    **Etiquette**    | Social grace and fitting in with various groups.
    **Fight**        | Hand to hand and melee weapons.
    **Focus**        | Relax, center, breath.
    **Influence**    | Empathy, intimidation, seduction, leadership, expression.
    **Investigation** | Investigation and research.
    **Occult**       | The history and practices of mystick traditions. A useful default skill for many kinds of mystick actions.
    **Science**      | Scientific disciplines and modern medicine.
    **Shoot**        | Ranged weapons.
    **Stealth**      | Sneaking and hiding.

    **Technology**   | Computers and technological devices.

### Specialties

  *Spend Character Dice to add Specialties to a Skill, up to d12.*

  Each skill is intentionally broad. Specialties represent more focused knowledge and training. A Specialty is less likely to be useful, but when it is, you can add it to your action pool along with the Skill it specializes.

## Arete

  *Arete starts at 'Sleep Walker' d4. You may spend Character Dice to increase it up to d12.*

  Arete is a mystick trait that represents your mystick will and enlightenment.

  It's the core of your ability to affect reality and is the base trait for any magickal action.

  You can spend Quintessence, not Plot Points, to add your Arete trait to a magickal action more than once.

  Arete also determined how free you are from the Instruments of your Focus. For every step of Arete above d6, 1 of your required Instruments becomes optional.

## Spheres

  *Each starts at 'Inexperienced' d4. Spend Character Dice to increase your Spheres. No sphere can be higher then your Arete.*

  The nine Spheres are mystick traits that represent your experience and ability affecting a specific facet of reality.

  Sphere                | Description
  ---------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------
    **Correspondence**  | Understanding of the connections between places, spaces, and things.
    **Entropy**         | Study of mortality, probability, and chaos.
    **Forces**          | Command over elemental energies.
    **Life**            | Influence over organic beings and the physical structures of living bodies.
    **Matter**          | Control of inert materials, objects, and solid elemental structures.
    **Mind**            | Influence over emotions and thoughts, including the ability to project consciousness from oneâ€™s physical body.
    **Prime**           | Control over primordial energies.
    **Spirit**          | Contact with Otherworldly spaces and entities.
    **Time**            | Perception of, and influence over, temporal states and time-based phenomena.

### Specialties

  *Spend Character Dice to add Specialties to a Sphere, up to d12. No specialty can be higher then your Arete.*

  Mages may develop specialties in specific aspects of a Sphere. 

## Backgrounds

  *A Mage starts with no Backgrounds, but can spend Character Dice to buy them.*

  Backgrounds can be mundane or mystickal and represent extra assets and benefits the character may enjoy.

  Many of them are external to the character.

  Some Backgrounds can be shared by a cabal meaning each mage contributes some number of Character Dice that are pooled together to determine the size of the trait. Shared backgrounds with more then 8 Character Dice invested use the [Traits beyond d12](#traits-beyond-d12) rule.

  Background    | Description
  -------------:|:-----------
    **Allies, Contacts, Backup, Gang, Cult, Servants, Spies, Retainers**| These might be magickal constructs who do your dishes and laundry, a cult of fanatic but mortal worshippers who do your bidding without question, a coven of other Mages you have a friendly relationship with, or it might simply be a mortal friend who works for the DMV.  
    **Arcane** | Gives a Mage an aura that makes them hard to find, detect, and even remember. Arcane can be used for stealth actions but also for just about any attempt to avoid detection including by electronic devices. It also means that the Mage will fade away from recording devices and the memories of beings. The larger the trait the faster and more completely it will happen.
    **Chantry** | A permanent base of operations for a cabal of Mages. Usually positioned on or near a Node. Which is a separate Trait.
    **Demesne** | Personal inner-dream realm.
    **Dreaming** | You can tap into a well of mundane knowledge. Once per session you can turn your Dreaming die into any mundane skill or specialty that you wish and use it as such for the rest of the session.
    **Fame, Influence, Rank** | You have recognition or power in the mundane world.
    **Familiar, Companion** | Familiars are quite useful. You have to feed them Quintessence regularly, but they can eat your paradox and also help you with mundane and mystickal tasks.
    **Library** | You have a collection of materials, commonly books, that can help you advance your mystick traits or research other magickal topics.
    **Mentor** | You have a relationship with a more experienced Mage who provides you some guidance and training.
    **Node** | A Node is a place where Quintessence collects. Nodes have a Resonance which affects the flavor of their energies and especially the physical form of Tass produced from that Node. A Node can hold at most 1 Quintessence per d6 invested. The Node's Quintessence will regenerate in full each week. Generally a Node's Quintessence will simply wait to be absorbed, but on occasion some amount of it will discharge into a physical form called Tass that can be stored or carried by a Mage, while the unbound Quintessence of the Node regenerates. Mage's skilled in Prime and Matter or Prime and Life can perform workings to coax Quintessence from a Node into Tass and so create a stock pile of magickal energies.
    **Patron** | Someone (or thing) in a position of power who has an interest in helping you.
    **Resources** | You have mundane wealth.
    **Sanctum** | A permanent place, sometimes in a chantry, that is aligned to your Focus instead of the Consensus. A Sanctum makes magick based on your Focus consequential and very useful for extended workings.
    **Status** | Favored position among other Mages.
    **Wonders** | Magical items.

## Character Dice

  You'll get Xd6 to spend on your Mage's traits. The cost for each die increases exponentially.

  Cost (d6) |  Die
  ----------| ----
    1/2     | d4
    1       | d6
    2       | d8
    4       | d10
    8       | d12

### Traits beyond d12

  Some traits allow you to invest more than 8 Character Dice. Extra points are applied to a second die for that trait.

  Cost (d6) | Dice
  ----------|-----
    9       | d12, d6
    10      | d12, d8
    12      | d12, d10
    16      | d12, d12
