# Making a Mage

  This is a guide for creating yourself a new Mage. 

## Concept

  *Describe who your Mage is in five words or so.*

  It helps to have a simple concept in mind as you create your character. It doesn't have to be complex, profound, or heroic, just something you can clearly imagine.

  You might be a "wizard private detective", or an "oracular sculptor."
  
## {Avatar}

  *Pick a type [Dynamic, Pattern, Primordial, or Questing](../Setting/Avatars.md) and characterize your avatar a bit.*

  *Avatar 1 costs 0d6, Avatar 2 costs 1d6, 3 costs 2d6, 4 costs 4d6, 5 costs 8d6, 6 costs 16d6*

  Avatar is a mystickal rating of how much personal Quintessence you can hold and how much, from any source, you can spend on a single magickal action.

## Focus

  *Pick a [Paradigm, at least one Magickal practice, and 7 Instruments](../Setting/Focus.md)*

  Focus encompasses both your fundamental beliefs about reality, and the nuts and bolts of how you perform magick.  

## Attributes

  *Assign d6, d8, d10 to the three Attributes: Physical, Mental, Social.*

  Attributes are mundane traits representing your general faculties.

  They form the base of most dice pools.

## Distinctions

  *Pick a Tradition and 3 more.*

  Distinctions are d8 mundane traits that represent facets of who you are. They might be relationships, affiliations, personality traits, unique backgrounds, powerful aspects of your personality, or other such things.

  Each distinction can be used as an ordinary d8 trait, but they also have special effects which provide most interesting mechanical effects.

### Special Effects (sfx)

  *Start with the default sfx. Create a negative sfx to add a positive one.*
  
  Each special effect has a name, a trigger, and an effect. The trigger is a condition for the effect to take effect.   
  
  The default trigger for each distinction is: 
  + Gain 1 PP when you roll a d4 instead of a d8.

  Common Triggers or Negative Effects:
  - Spend a Plot Point.
  - Step back a beneficial trait such as an attribute, skill, or asset.
  - Set up a detrimental trait, like a complication.
  - Choose to do or introduce something risky, dumb, or complicated.
  - Create a d8 complication. 
  
  Common Positive Effects:
  - Earn a Plot Points.
  - Step up a beneficial trait.
  - Double a beneficial trait.
  - Step back a non-beneficial trait.
  - Introduce a narrative detail.
  - Reroll one die.
  - Create a d8 asset for the rest of scene.

## Skills

  *All skills start at 'Untrained' d4. Spend Character Dice to advance them up to 'Master' d12.*

  Skills are mundane traits that represent distinct areas of expertise and training.

  Skill              | Description

  Table: Skills 

### Specialties

  *Spend a Character Die to add Specialties to a Skill. Each Specialty is a d6.*

  Each skill is intentionally broad. Specialties represent focused knowledge and training. A Specialty is less likely to be useful, but when it is, you can add an additional d6 to your action pool along with the Skill it specializes.

## Arete

  *Arete starts at 'Sleep Walker' d4. You may spend Character Dice to increase it up to d12.*

  Arete is a mystick trait that represents your mystick will and enlightenment.

  It's the core of your ability to affect reality and is the base trait for any magickal action.

  You can spend Quintessence, not Plot Points, to add your Arete trait to a magickal action more than once.

  Arete also determined how free you are from the Instruments of your Focus. For every step of Arete above d6, 1 of your required Instruments becomes optional.

## Spheres

  *Each starts at 'Inexperienced' d4. Spend Character Dice to increase your Spheres. No sphere can be higher then your Arete.*

  The nine Spheres are mystick traits that represent your experience and ability affecting a specific facet of reality.

  Sphere                | Description
  ---------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------
  **Correspondence**   | Understanding of the connections between places, spaces, and things.
  **Entropy**          | Study of mortality, probability, and chaos.
  **Forces**           | Command over elemental energies.
  **Life**             | Influence over organic beings and the physical structures of living bodies.
  **Matter**           | Control of inert materials, objects, and solid elemental structures.
  **Mind**             | Influence over emotions and thoughts, including the ability to project consciousness from oneâ€™s physical body.
  **Prime**            | Control over primordial energies.
  **Spirit**           | Contact with Otherworldly spaces and entities.
  **Time**             | Perception of, and influence over, temporal states and time-based phenomena.

### Specialties

  *Spend a Character Die to add Specialties to a Sphere. Each specialty is a d6.*

  Many Mages may develop specialties in specific aspects of a Sphere. When the specialty applies, you may add an additional d6 to your dice pool. 

## Backgrounds

  *A Mage starts with no Backgrounds, but can spend Character Dice to buy them.*

  Backgrounds can be mundane or mystickal and represent extra assets and benefits the character may enjoy.

  Many of them are external to the character.

  Some Backgrounds can be shared by a cabal meaning each mage contributes one or more traits of whatever size they wish that are then pooled together to represent the various benefits of that background. 
  
  Background    | Description
  -------------:|:-----------
  **Allies, Contacts, Backup, Gang, Cult, Servants, Spies, Retainers** | These might be magickal constructs who do your dishes and laundry, a cult of fanatic but mortal worshippers who do your bidding without question, a coven of other Mages you have a friendly relationship with, or it might simply be a mortal friend who works for the DMV.  
  **Arcane**    | Gives a Mage an aura that makes them hard to find, detect, and even remember. Arcane can be used for stealth actions but also for just about any attempt to avoid detection including by electronic devices. It also means that the Mage will fade away from recording devices and the memories of beings. The larger the trait the faster and more completely it will happen.
  **Chantry**   | A permanent base of operations for a cabal of Mages. Usually positioned on or near a Node. Which is a separate Trait.
  **Demesne**   | Personal inner-dream realm.
  **Dreaming**  | You can tap into a well of mundane knowledge. Once per session you can turn your Dreaming die into any mundane skill or specialty that you wish and use it as such for the rest of the session.
  **Fame, Influence, Rank** | You have recognition or power in the mundane world.
  **Familiar, Companion** | Familiars are quite useful. You have to feed them Quintessence regularly, but they can eat your paradox and also help you with mundane and mystickal tasks.
  **Library**   | You have a collection of materials, commonly books, that can help you advance your mystick traits or research other magickal topics.
  **Mentor**    | You have a relationship with a more experienced Mage who provides you some guidance and training.
  **Node**      | A Node is a place where Quintessence collects. Nodes have a Resonance which affects the flavor of their energies and especially the physical form of Tass produced from that Node. A Node can hold at most 1 Quintessence per d6 invested. The Node's Quintessence will regenerate in full each week. Generally a Node's Quintessence will simply wait to be absorbed, but on occasion some amount of it will discharge into a physical form called Tass that can be stored or carried by a Mage, while the unbound Quintessence of the Node regenerates. Mage's skilled in Prime and Matter or Prime and Life can perform workings to coax Quintessence from a Node into Tass and so create a stock pile of magickal energies.
  **Patron**    | Someone (or thing) in a position of power who has an interest in helping you.
  **Resources** | You have mundane wealth.
  **Sanctum**   | A permanent place, sometimes in a chantry, that is aligned to your Focus instead of the Consensus. A Sanctum makes magick based on your Focus consequential and very useful for extended workings.
  **Status**    | Favored position among other Mages.
  **Wonders**   | Magical items.

## Character Dice

  You'll get Xd6 to spend on your Mage's traits. The cost for each die increases exponentially.

  Cost (d6) |  Die
  ----------| ----
  1/2*      | d4 (typically you get d4 for free)
  1         | d6
  2         | d8
  4         | d10
  8         | d12

  Table: Cost of Traits in Character Dice (d6)

### Traits beyond d12

  More powerful characters may reach traits that go beyond a d12. In these cases additional dice can be added to the trait to extend it beyond d12. 
  
  The cost for a second die is double the cost of the original. If, somehow, a third die is added the cost for that is 4x the original 

  Cost (d6)    | Dice
  -------------|-----
  10 (8+2)     | d12, d6
  14 (8+4)     | d12, d8
  16 (8+8)     | d12, d10
  24 (8+16)    | d12, d12
  28 (8+16+4)  | d12, d12, d6
  32 (8+16+8)  | d12, d12, d8
