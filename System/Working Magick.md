# Working Magick

  Reality may seem like a solid wall to bounce your head against, but it's true nature is far more malleable then that. There are some few people who've awakened to this and with their Will can affect changes in reality. We call this *Magick*.   

## Effect
  
  Begin by clearly stating what you will change about reality. This is your narrative *effect* and it may be literally anything. As grand and unlikely as you can imagine, but be warned, the bigger your effect the more dice you'll give reality to resist you. 

  It's not a requirement, but if you can define your effect within the context of your magickal *practice* it will be much easier to succeed because you'll be able to add dice from your mundane traits and not just your mystickal ones.

## Spheres

  Mysticks traditionally parcel all of reality into nine *spheres* to facilitate their studies. Each sphere represents your understanding of some facet of reality and your ability to manipulate it.  

  Correspondence
  ~ space, places, and relations between things
  ~ the distance, real or metaphorical, between you and the target of your spell is a correspondence effect

  Entropy
  ~ decay, chaos, and probability

  Forces
  ~ elemental energies: fire, ice, gravity
  
  Life
  ~ things that live

  Matter
  ~ things that do not live

  Mind
  ~ sapience 

  Prime
  ~ primordial energies of reality
  ~ how long your spell will last is an effect of Prime.

  Spirit
  ~ Other worlds and their entities. 

  Time
  ~ Perception and flow of temporal reality.

## Breaking it Down

  Once your effect is clear enough to see what Spheres are involved, you can determine dice and roll.  

  > For example: You need to cross a gap between two building to escape some technocratic agents. Your *Effect* is to take a quick herbal concoction to enhance your musculature, making it possible to leap the distance. This clearly invokes your Occult skill and Herbalism specialty. Enhancing your own body requires using the Life Sphere.
 
  > Alternately: You might calculate the coordinates of the rooftop you wish to be on and run a quick script on your wrist computer to alter your token's position in the virtual reality simulation that is reality; effectively teleporting across the distance. This accomplishes the same goal, but clearly uses Technology and the sphere of Correspondence.   

  Once your *Effect* is clear enough that you can assemble a dice pool for your action, you'll roll and determine a *total* for reality to attempt to meet or beat with dice based on how radical and complex your *Effect* is. 

  If reality's total fails to meet or beat the total for your effect, then your working will succeed. You may generate some Paradox from a successful effect, but if your effect fails you are guaranteed to generate Paradox.
  
  Once you have a clear intent for your Effect break it down into discrete component Spheres and determine the level required from each Sphere.

  It is possible for your Effect to have multiple components of the same Sphere.
  
  > For example, if your magickal attack has a d8 Fire effect and a d8 electricity effect, you have two Forces 3 components.
  > In this case you add your Forces trait once, and reality get 2d8 to resist your working.

## Range

  The Range of your Effect will be a Correspondence component.
  The distance your effect will reach across. \[this is a targeting kind of thing\]

  Trait | Range
  -----:|-------
  D4    | Only yourself.
  D6    | Takes your action. Pass the initiative.
  D8    | Takes this action and your next one.
  D10   | Takes the scene.
  D12   | Takes longer than the scene.

## Duration

  The Duration of your Effect will be Prime component.
  How long will your effect last?

  Trait | Duration
  -----:|---------
  d4    | No Time. Lasts only long enough for a reaction.
  d6    | Lasts until your next action.
  d8    | Lasts for a Scene.
  d10   | Lasts until the next dusk/dawn.
  d12   | Lasts for a Season.

## Scope

  {I have an outstanding question about if scope is a thing. It may very well be a part of the effect die. but it could be a separate thing for you to have to deal with. A d12 effect might be strong but it might also be limited in scope to a single target. If you keep your scope limited to yourself, then reality will generate more opportunities for you to activate. Which is }
  How large and widespread is your effect?

  Trait | Scope
  -----:|------
  D4    | Only yourself
  D6    | One person
  D8    | A crowd
  D10   | A Building
  D12   | Takes longer than the scene.






## Casting Time

## Focused Magick

  Your focus describes a belief about how reality works and also concrete ways through which you focus the power of your beliefs to shape reality to better fit your belief.

  Focused magick is much easier to accomplish because it allows you to enlist dice from mundane traits such as skills and attributes in your working. The drawback is that your *Effect* is limited by your belief and especially the nature of your practice. If suddenly growing armored skin is not an *Effect* that fits into your Focus, then it's not a *Effect* you can accomplish with Focused Magick.   


### Focused Magick Dice Pool

  - Attribute
    - Based upon your focus and your effect
  - Skill
    - Based upon your focus and effect
    - Can include specialty dice
  - Distinction
    - Especially a Tradition can help or hinder workings
    - Scene distinctions can also help or hinder
  - Arete
    - If you spend Quintessence, you may include your Arete trait an  additional time for each point of Quintessence
  - Spheres
    - Include the dice from all the Spheres involved in the effect, especially  d4s
    - Additional Sphere traits cannot be added with PP
  - Assets
    - Mundane assets such wand or sword must relate to your Focus. Perhaps by   being of historical significance
    - Resonance is a mystic asset which you can use if it relates to your   Effect
  - Complications
    - The scene, or the target of your effect may have a complication friendly  to your Focus or Effect which you can include in your dice pool
  - Time
    - If you spend extra time performing your working
    - The demands of your focal instruments may affect what's possible here.


## Raw Magick

  Raw magick is an instantaneous working of pure will that transcends all of your beliefs about reality. It is often a desperate Mage's last resort because it is difficult and dangerous. 
  
  You can use only your Mystickal traits when working Raw Magick which means fewer dice and a greater chance of failure. On the other hand, the *Effect* of Raw Magick is not bound by your practice and requires no instruments or preparation.  

### Raw Magick Dice Pool

  - Arete
    - You may spend Quintessence of any kind of a raw working
  - Spheres
    - Include the dice from all the Spheres involved in the effect, even if   they are d4
    - Additional Sphere traits cannot be added with PP
  - Assets
    - Resonance is a mystic asset which you can use if it relates to your   Effect
  - Time
    - If you spend extra time performing your working



  How long you take to achieve your working.
  
  Trait | Casting Time
  -----:|-------------
  d4    | No time. You can also take a mundane action before or after this
  d6    | Takes the length of your action. Pass the initiative
  d8    | Takes this action and your next one
  d10   | Takes the length of this scene
  d12   | Takes longer than this scene

## Reality Resists Your Working

  Once you've rolled to create your effect, Reality will oppose you with a dice pool that's composed based on the effect you are attempting to create.

### Reality Dice Pool

  - The Size of your Effect (d6 or larger)
    - This can be a single Effect larger than d12
      - For example, a d12,d6 Effect could take out someone in a single action but Reality will get a d12 and a d6 to resist
    - It can also be multiple Effects
      - if needed, you can declare several different Effects
        - Reality gets to add all of them
  - The Level of Sphere effects you are attempting
    - From d4 to d12.
    - A Life 3 Effect would be a d8. A Prime 5, Mind 5 Effect would be 2d12.
    - Duration is a Prime effect
    - Range is a Correspondence effect
  - The scope of the effect
    - From d4 to d12 or more
  - Paradox
    - Reality can spend dice from a mage's paradox to add to it's pool to resist a working
    - And can optionally pay the affected mage a PP per die to keep them

## Outcomes

  For Coincidental workings Reality gets 2 dice for it's total.

  For Vulgar workings Reality gets 3 dice for it's total and you'll get an extra d6 Paradox regardless of whether your working succeeds or fails.

  If you meet or beat reality's total your working is a success. Otherwise, your effect dice gets added to your paradox pool, and perhaps greater retribution if paradox burns off.

## Resisting workings, targeting sleepers or other awakened

  > some notes to make here. Need to clean up the correspondence and prime vs. just strait up duration traits. So that it's clear how to make an effect. 
  > also, need to workout what happens when you target someone. 
  > I think this right now: if you target a sleeper, they can't resist with magic. They can maybe resist with mundane traits, based on your effect, but that's it. As a mage you have to beat both reality and their resistance? or maybe not. Maybe you can just blurgh sleepers all you want? 
  > if you target someone with magick though, they can add their arete and avatar rating, which now becomes a trait, to reality's dice pool. or maybe just avatar? eitherway, they are harder to effect, and if they detect your working they can work their own countermagick which allows them to roll a full magickal counter?
  > then what? the main issue here is do we add to reality's dice pool, or do we all for a second resistance roll that you must also beat? Either one is possible, but which is easier?
  > if its a second roll, like, someone could still roll to dodge the physical manifestation of your spell? I don't like that. but if we just add to reality's pool...the main thing to ask is how avatar and arete actualyl work. logically, not mechanically. the more you know about how magick works in the SETTING the easier these kinds of questions are to answer. Therefore, as a mage you can resist a working directed at you with your avatar. And various sanctums traits and such for your location. If you are aware of the working and resist it, you can add your arete. If you practice some countermagick based on your correct
  > Counter-magick is page 546 in the m20 book
  > from their perspective, if you successfully create a fireball you still have to hit someone with it. 
  > which I am dubious about. 
  > thats two rolls for the same thing. and, if your working includes, say, shoot for shooting, then there's no need to make a second attack roll, but...and this is a but, it may be that they can dodge your physical attack if they can see it coming. Which does kinda mean that they get a chance to make a roll to beat your total. just like reality does. eh, there are worse things. 
  > be free with information to the players. There's no need to hide things. With Cortex plus it will all even out. 
  > which says to me, that you can dodge physical effects maybe, you can also resist magic if you have an avatar and some arete.  Avatar is always added. 
  > I wonder if you could thus, mundanely resist mind control? that's what willpower was suppose to be for.

## Ritual Workings

  \[draft\] If two mages have compatible paradigms they can cooperate on a working with a greater chance of success.

  For ritual workings, I think you can pool your sphere dice together. And perhaps Arete? Probably. You can pool your Raw magick dice and get greater chance of success, but of course, if there's paradox involved, it will apply to every mage in the working.

## Summary

  Describe the narrative effect you want and decide the Effect dice, Duration, Range, and Scope, then roll your Magick dice pool.

  - Magick Dice Pool. Arete, the Spheres needed for the effect, and a Casting Time die for how long you take to work the effect.

  - Your two highest dice are you total. (Your Effect die comes from your initial choice, not from your dice pool)

  - Opportunities you roll can be activated to add/step up your Paradox; or to trigger a backlash complication.

  Then Reality rolls a reaction against your working using: your Effect dice the level of the Spheres required for the effect, and the Duration, Range and Scope you decided upon.

  - If there are Sleeper witnesses Reality can add a die from d6 to d12 depending on how many there are and how rigid their sense of reality is.

  - If your working is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total.

  - If your working is Coincidental Reality only gets 2 for it's total and Sleepers can be used as an Asset.

  - Opportunities can be activated to trigger a Paradox backlash of your own choice.

  If your total meets or beats reality's your effect is successful and you can apply your Effect dice to your targets.

  If you fail, your effect dice get added to your Paradox or trigger a backlash that may draw in more of your existing Paradox.
