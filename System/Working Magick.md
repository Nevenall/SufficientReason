# Working Magick
  
  Working magick.

## Focused Magick

  Your focus describes a collection of beliefs about how reality works and tools through which you focus the power of those beliefs into magick.

  When performing focused magick start by defining the Effect of your working; specifically how it flows from your focus. The clearer your statement of narrative intent is the easier the rest of the process will be.

### Spheres

  Once you have a clear intent for your Effect break it down into discrete component Spheres and determine the level required from each Sphere.

  It is possible for your Effect to have multiple components of the same Sphere.
  
  > For example, if your magickal attack has a d8 Fire effect and a d8 electricity effect, you have two Forces 3 components.
  > In this case you add your Forces trait once, and reality get 2d8 to resist your working.

### Range

  The Range of your Effect will be a Correspondence component.

### Duration

  The Duration of your Effect will be Prime component.

### Focused Magick Dice Pool

  - Attribute
    - Based upon your focus and your effect
  - Skill
    - Based upon your focus and effect
    - Can include specialty dice
  - Distinction
    - Especially a Tradition can help or hinder workings
    - Scene distinctions can also help or hinder
  - Arete
    - If you spend Quintessence, you may include your Arete trait an  additional time for each point of Quintessence
  - Spheres
    - Include the dice from all the Spheres involved in the effect, especially  d4s
    - Additional Sphere traits cannot be added with PP
  - Assets
    - Mundane assets such wand or sword must relate to your Focus. Perhaps by   being of historical significance
    - Resonance is a mystic asset which you can use if it relates to your   Effect
  - Complications
    - The scene, or the target of your effect may have a complication friendly  to your Focus or Effect which you can include in your dice pool
  - Time
    - If you spend extra time performing your working
    - The demands of your focal instruments may affect what's possible here.

## Raw Magick

  It's possible to perform workings that are not focused through your paradigm and instead rely upon your raw will and experience with reality. These can be very difficult to achieve and thus quite dangerous.

### Raw Magick Dice Pool

  - Arete
    - You may spend Quintessence of any kind of a raw working
  - Spheres
    - Include the dice from all the Spheres involved in the effect, even if   they are d4
    - Additional Sphere traits cannot be added with PP
  - Assets
    - Resonance is a mystic asset which you can use if it relates to your   Effect
  - Time
    - If you spend extra time performing your working

## Casting Time

  How long you take to achieve your working.
  
  Trait | Casting Time
  -----:|-------------
  d4    | No time. You can also take a mundane action before or after this
  d6    | Takes the length of your action. Pass the initiative
  d8    | Takes this action and your next one
  d10   | Takes the length of this scene
  d12   | Takes longer than this scene

## Reality Resists Your Working

  Once you've rolled to create your effect, Reality will oppose you with a dice pool that's composed based on the effect you are attempting to create.

### Reality Dice Pool

  - The Size of your Effect (d6 or larger)
    - This can be a single Effect larger than d12
      - For example, a d12,d6 Effect could take out someone in a single action but Reality will get a d12 and a d6 to resist
    - It can also be multiple Effects
      - if needed, you can declare several different Effects
        - Reality gets to add all of them
  - The Level of Sphere effects you are attempting
    - From d4 to d12.
    - A Life 3 Effect would be a d8. A Prime 5, Mind 5 Effect would be 2d12.
    - Duration is a Prime effect
    - Range is a Correspondence effect
  - The scope of the effect
    - From d4 to d12 or more
  - Paradox
    - Reality can spend dice from a mage's paradox to add to it's pool to resist a working
    - And can optionally pay the affected mage a PP per die to keep them

## Outcomes

  For Coincidental workings Reality gets 2 dice for it's total.

  For Vulgar workings Reality gets 3 dice for it's total and you'll get an extra d6 Paradox regardless of whether your working succeeds or fails.

  If you meet or beat reality's total your working is a success. Otherwise, your effect dice gets added to your paradox pool, and perhaps greater retribution if paradox burns off.

## Duration

  How long will your effect last?

  Trait | Duration
  -----:|---------
  d4    | No Time. Lasts only long enough for a reaction.
  d6    | Lasts until your next action.
  d8    | Lasts for a Scene.
  d10   | Lasts until the next dusk/dawn.
  d12   | Lasts for a Season.

## Range

  The distance your effect will reach across. \[this is a targeting kind of thing\]

  Trait | Range
  -----:|-------
  D4    | Only yourself.
  D6    | Takes your action. Pass the initiative.
  D8    | Takes this action and your next one.
  D10   | Takes the scene.
  D12   | Takes longer than the scene.

## Scope

  How large and widespread is your effect?

  Trait | Scope
  -----:|------
  D4    | Only yourself
  D6    | One person
  D8    | A crowd
  D10   | A Building
  D12   | Takes longer than the scene.

## Ritual Workings

  \[draft\] If two mages have compatible paradigms they can cooperate on a working with a greater chance of success.

  For ritual workings, I think you can pool your sphere dice together. And perhaps Arete? Probably. You can pool your Raw magick dice and get greater chance of success, but of course, if there's paradox involved, it will apply to every mage in the working.

## Summary

  Describe the narrative effect you want and decide the Effect dice, Duration, Range, and Scope, then roll your Magick dice pool.

  - Magick Dice Pool. Arete, the Spheres needed for the effect, and a Casting Time die for how long you take to work the effect.

  - Your two highest dice are you total. (Your Effect die comes from your initial choice, not from your dice pool)

  - Opportunities you roll can be activated to add/step up your Paradox; or to trigger a backlash complication.

  Then Reality rolls a reaction against your working using: your Effect dice the level of the Spheres required for the effect, and the Duration, Range and Scope you decided upon.

  - If there are Sleeper witnesses Reality can add a die from d6 to d12 depending on how many there are and how rigid their sense of reality is.

  - If your working is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total.

  - If your working is Coincidental Reality only gets 2 for it's total and Sleepers can be used as an Asset.

  - Opportunities can be activated to trigger a Paradox backlash of your own choice.

  If your total meets or beats reality's your effect is successful and you can apply your Effect dice to your targets.

  If you fail, your effect dice get added to your Paradox or trigger a backlash that may draw in more of your existing Paradox.
