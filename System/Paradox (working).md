## Paradox
  
  Paradox is an expression of reality's resistance to being manipulated by the awakened. It accumulates as a Complication which hinders workings; it weaves its way into spells as flaws and unintended consequences; and sometimes paradox explodes in a reality bending backlash against a mage that can scar, twist, or trap them in a bubble of strange reality known as Quiet. 

  Paradox can be generated only when an enlightened will is invoked to affect changes in reality. It's created in the smallest way from spoilers rolled on magickal actions, and in a more serious way from attempting vulgar magick, but the most dangerous cause of paradox is failing a magickal action.

### The Paradox Complication

  Each mage has a single complication which represents their personal accumulation of paradox, growing and waiting to discharge.
  
#### Detecting Paradox

  The size of a mage's Paradox complication can be detected with a Prime 1 effect.

#### Paradox Hinders Magick

  When resisting a mage's workings reality adds that mage's Paradox complication to it's dice pool.

  If mage's are performing a group working, each mage is responsible for a part of the overall effect and each mage will be resisted separately. 

#### Gaining Paradox

  When reality resists a feat, set your paradox complication equal to the size of effect dice you attempted. If the effect die is equal to or less than your current paradox, step up your paradox instead. 

  When you attempt vulgar magick in front of sleeper witnesses, your paradox is stepped up once regardless of whether your feat succeeds or fails. 

  Attempting vulgar magick without sleeper witnesses doesn't automatically earn your paradox, but it is still dangerous. 

#### Losing Paradox

  There are some ways to help deal with paradox. A familiar can share the burden with a mage, or a Prime effect can be used to trigger a paradox backlash in a controlled environment. But there are no known ways of removing or avoiding paradox. 

  Paradox will continue to build up until it all discharges in a single event known as a backlash. 

### Backlash

  A backlash is a discharge that rends at the fabric of a mage's being. When it occurs all of a mage's accumulated paradox energy suddenly pours into their pattern in a cascade that either marks them with a weird or traps them in the dreaded quiet. 

  Reality can be strangely capricious about when exactly a backlash occurs. They can happen any time, but usually happen at the worst possible moments; such as when a mage's working was resisted and they've suddenly accumulated a significant amount of paradox.

  There are four possible effects of a backlash. When one happens you must choose two of the effects to inflict upon your mage. Many of them can be chosen twice with increasingly serious consequences.

#### Burn

  When the energies of a paradox course through your pattern and injure your flesh, it's call burn. 
  
  Turn your paradox complication in a physical harm complication. 
  
  If you choose burn twice, instead take a permanent d6 physical complication, or step up an existing one. This physical complication is also a mystick trait. It represents a scar in your metaphysical being and cannot be healed. It will persist however else you might change your life pattern.  

  If a harm complication is larger then d12 you will face death.

#### Permanent Paradox

  Sometimes paradox permanently invades your pattern and grows there like a cancer, twisting your being into a nightmarish offense to reality.

  Take a d6 permanent paradox complication, or step up your existing one. This counts as two choices.

  You now always have a paradox complication from which to begin accumulating more. When you experience backlash, it's at your current level, but instead of removing all paradox, you return to the level of your permanent trait. 

  If your permanent paradox ever exceeds d12 your mage looses protagonist status and becomes an NPC. 

#### Weirds

  Often paradox will mark you in ways that make it difficult to pass for mortal like spoiling milk and wilting plants in your presence, or causing you to vomit snakes wherever you attempt to speak a lie. These strange effects are called weirds, and many of them have become a familiar part of magick even in the larger sleeper culture. All the better to make a mage as different and dangerous.

  Turn your paradox complication into a weird complication that will last until you can activate enough opportunities to remove it. 

  If you choose this twice, instead take a permanent d6 weird, or step up an existing one.  

  Like the other forms of paradox backlash, a weird is a change to a mage's pattern and cannot be healed or concealed. 

  The larger the weird complication the more serious, obvious, and limiting it is. Weirds larger then d12 can not simply be reduced by activating opportunities, the mage will require some kind of narrative justification to begain the recovery process.

  There is no limit to the size of a weird. It can exceed d12 without turning you into an NPC, but weirds that large are very limiting.

  Trait   | Example Weirds
  :------:|:---------------
  d4      |  
  d6      |
  d8      |
  d10     |
  d12     |
  d12,d4  |
  d12,d6  |

#### Quiet

  Sometimes a paradox backlash attacks the mage with hallucinations, personality changes, madness, and vegetative states which serve to disconnnect them from their community, their mind, and reality itself. 

  Quiet is much feared by mages because it pulls apart already tenuous groups and leaves individuals vulnerable and alone. Severe Quiets leave the mage in a total vegatative state, stripped of magickal power, and only able to interact with a strange nightmare world.

  Turn your paradox complication into a Quiet complication that will last until you can activate enough opportunities to remove it. 

  If you choose this twice, instead take a permenant d6 quiet, or step up an existing one. 

  Deep Quiets, larger then d12, place the mage's body in a vegetative state, and trap their mind in an endless hallucination unable to access their magickal ability. 

   Trait   | Example Quiets
  :------:|:---------------
  d4      |  
  d6      |
  d8      |
  d10     |
  d12     |
  d12,d4  |
  d12,d6  |

##### Escaping from Deep Quiet

  Escaping from deep quiet requires more then simply activating some opportunties. This could be a solo quest for the mage, similar to a Seeking for increased Arete. Or simply narrated as a montage.
