## Paradox
  
  Paradox is an expression of reality's resistance to being manupulated by the awakened. It accumulates as a Complication which hinders workings; it weaves its way into spells as flaws and unintended consequences; and sometimes paradox explodes in a reality bending backlash against a mage that can scar, twist, or trap them in a bubble of strange reality known as Quiet. 

  Paradox can be generated only when an enlightened will is invoked to affect changes in reality. It's created in the smallest way from spoilers rolled on magickal actions, and in a more serious way from attempting vulgar magick, but the most dangerous cause of paradox is failing a magickal action.

### The Paradox Complication

  Each mage has a single complication which represents their personal accumulation of paradox, growing and waiting to discharge.
  
#### Detecting Paradox

  The size of a mage's Paradox complication can be detected with a Prime 1 effect.

#### Paradox Hinders Magick

  When resisting a mage's workings reality adds that mage's Paradox complication to it's dice pool.

  If mage's are performing a group working, each mage is responsible for a part of the overall effect and each mage will be resisted separately. 

#### Gaining Paradox

  When reality resists a feat, set your paradox complication equal to the size of effect dice you attempted. If the effect die is equal to or less than your current paradox, step up your paradox instead. 

  When you atttempt vulgar magick in front of sleeper witnesses, your paradox is stepped up once regardless of whether your feat succeeds or fails. 

  Attempting vulgar magick without sleeper witnesses doesn't automatically earn your paradox, but it is still dangerous. 

#### Losing Paradox

  There are some ways to help deal with paradox. A familiar can share the burden with a mage, or a Prime effect can be used to trigger a paradox backlash in a controlled environment. But there are no known ways of removing or avoiding paradox. 

  Paradox will continue to build up until it all discharges in a single event known as a backlash. 

### Backlash

  A backlash is a discharge that rends at the fabric of a mage's being. When it occurs all of a mage's accumulated paradox energy suddenly pours into their pattern in a cascade that either marks them with a weird or traps them in the dreaded quiet. 

  Realty can be strangely capricious about when exactly a backlash occurs. They can happen any time, but usually happen at the worst possible momements; such as when a mage's working was resisted and they've suddenly accumulated a signifigant amount of paradox.

  There are four possible effects of a backlash. When one happens you must choose two of the effects to inflict upon your mage. Many of them can be chosen twice with increasingly serious consequences.

#### Burn

  When the energies of a paradox course through your pattern and injure your flesh, it's call burn. 
  
  Turn your paradox complication in a physical harm complication. 
  
  If you choose burn twice, instead take a permenent d6 physical complication, or step up an existing one. This physical complication is also a mystick trait. It represents a scar in your metaphysical being and cannot be healed. It will persist however else you might change your life pattern.  

  If a harm complication is larger then d12 you will face death.

#### Permenant Paradox

  Sometimes paradox permenantly invades your pattern and grows there like a cancer, twisting your being into a nightmarish offense to reality.

  Take a d6 permenant paradox complication, or step up your existing one. This counts as two choices.

  You now always have a paradox complication from which to begin accumulating more. When you experience backlash, it's at your current level, but instead of removing all paradox, you return to the level of your permenant trait. 

  If your permenant paradox ever exceeds d12 your mage looses protagonist status and becomes an NPC. 

#### Weirds

  Often paradox will mark you in ways that make it difficult to pass for mortal like spoiling milk and wilting plants in your presence.

  Turn your paradox complication into a weird complication that will last until you can activate enough opportunities to remove it. 

  If you choose this twice, instead take a permenant d6 weird, or step up an existing one.  

  Like the other forms of paradox backlash, a weird is a change to a mage's pattern and cannot be healed or concealed. 

  The larger the weird complication the more serious, obvious, and limiting it is. 

  There is no limit to the size of a weird. It can exceed d12 without turning you into an NPC, but weirds that large are very limting.

  Trait   | Example Weirds
  :------:|:---------------
  d4      |  
  d6      |
  d8      |
  d10     |
  d12     |
  d12,d4  |
  d12,d6  |

#### Quiet

  Sometimes reality attempts to protect itself from a mage by separating their mind from their body and avatar. Isolating them in a living dream called a quiet.    
  
   A strange state where, from the outside a mage appears to be brain dead or in deep coma, but to the mage, the are trapped in some strange and fantastic realm. 

  ? 
    Does your avatar follow you into quiet? or is it more interesting if you are without access to your magick?
    maybe that's what a quiet is, separating you from your avatar. Maybe it's the avatar that is truely lost in quiet. 
    It's like the egyptian two soul kind of action.

  Paradox  | Duration          | Scope of backlash
  :-------:|:-----------------:|:------------------
  d4       | Several scenes    | A trivial weird like souring milk or beer, or wilting plants.

  more     | Permenant         | The mage is lost in a forever quiet. Some suspect this is how maurauders are born.

### Weirds

  A weird is a complication that marks someone as a mage and, at the least, makes it more difficult to pass as an ordinary mortal. Some weirds are trivial, like souring milk or beer, and fade quickly. Other weirds can permenantly twist a mage into premature decrepatude. 

  ?
    need to figure out the weirds scale. What is the duration, what is the degree of hindrance. 
    Do they fade automatically, or can you find ways to remove, or overcome them? Are they all permenant, just some as easier to get rid of then others? mmm...
  ?

### Quiet

  ?
    what is a quiet like from the outside, and from the inside. From the outside it looks exactly like a coma or brain death. 
    From the inside it's a whole realm of strangness. The most important thing is how do you escape it? 
  ?

### Generating Paradox
  
  When a mage rolls an opportunity on a magickal action it generates paradox. The GM will give the Mage one PP to activate all the opportunities rolled. Each opportunity can be used in one of several ways, but all are immediate and can even give reality extra dice to resist this feat.

  - Add a d6 to the Mage's Paradox 
    - Step up the die for each extra opportunity used
  - Step up one of the Mage's lowest Paradox dice
  - Work a d6 flaw into the Mage's feat
    - Step up that flaw for each extra opportunity used

#### When a Mage's Feat is Resisted

  If a mage's feat is successfully resisted by reality, this also generates paradox. The effect dice of the feat are added to the mage's paradox dice. Reality may then choose trigger a backlash. 

#### When a Mage Attempts a Vulgar Feat

  ? if a mage attempts a vulgar feat, this might also generate paradox automatically, depends on how it works for balance ?

#### Resisting Feats

  Reality can add any number of dice from a Mage's Paradox to it's pool for resisting a feat. Any paradox greater then the feat's effect dice will be lost unless the GM gives the Mage 1 PP per extra die to retain them. 

#### Flaws

   Flaws in your magickal feats are a lesser form of paradox that can occur when your roll opportunities. They sometimes affect the spell itself. Draining off Quintessence and making its effect fade faster then you wished. Often flaws manifest as unintended consequences of your feat as reality is forced to accept and integrate it. For example, a flaw might ignite some fuel you didn't know was there and turn your small fire spell into a raging inferno. A life spell to enhances your reflexes might also, because of a flaw, spike your metabolism and require you to eat twice as often or be afflicted with hunger and lightheadedness.
  
  When a mage rolls opportunities on a feat, reality may choose to sneak a flaw into their feat instead of saving the paradox for later. 

  Flaws can complicate the mage's feat, but can't contradict it. For example, a flaw in a wall of fire feat can't change or reduce the effect dice of the fire, but it could cause blowback to damage the mage, or complicate the situation by setting something important on fire. 

  Flaws are more meaningful when the mage is attempting a long lasting working, like creating a wonder. Such complications last as long as the working does, which is one reason a Sanctum is so important for mage's planning on performing extended workings.

#### Backlash

  Backlash is a direct attempt by reality to protect itself by isolating the mage. 
    
  Besides the paradox generated when reality successfully resists a mage's feat a backlash might also be triggered. A backlash is something like an immune response to a mage, and it might inflict the mage with a persistent supernatural quirk or plunge them into a serious Quiet. 

  When a backlash is triggered the GM will burn and roll all of the mage's accumulated paradox dice plus any technocratic locality trait. The two highest rolling dice will be the total, and the largest remaining die will the size of the backlash. If there are no dice left, the backlash will start at d6.

  Then the Mage rolls to resist the backlash. The applicable traits are Mind, Arete, Prime, Paradox Prime specialty, Sanctum (if you are luck enough to be in one friendly to your focus), and Familiar. Some Distinctions and Wonders may also be of use if they specialized around paradox. 

  If the mage resists, they will be left with only a temporary paradox complication the size of the backlash. If they fail, the result will be a much longer lasting paradox flaw. 

  The backlash is stepped up for every 5 reality wins by, and if the backlash becomes larger then d12 the mage will be thrown into quiet instead of receiving a paradox flaw. 

##### Paradox Complications 

  These range from the inconvenient, such as instantly withering plants, to very intense, like being unable to answer a question with anything but excessive honesty, or continuously vomiting slime. 

  Paradox complications can be cruel, ironic or just eerie. It sometimes seem to relate to the mage involved but not always.

###### Recovering from Paradox Complications

  Mages lucky enough to resist a backlash will get a temporary paradox complication which lasts for the rest of a particular story. 
  
  If the mage fails to resist, their complication is permanent until they have bought it off with Character Dice and some sufficient magickal work. 

  Buying off such a complication takes the same number of dice that it would to buy. And the complication can be bought down by spending a few character dice at a time.

##### Quiet

  Quiet is a vegetative sort of state where a mage is very much removed from the consensus reality and trapped in a bizarre world inside their head. 
  
  Quiet might turn into a solo quest for a mage to find a way out, or it might be a chance for the player to retire that character and start a new one. Quiet can be the end of a character's protagonism, or the beginning of a story. 

###### Recovering from Quiet

  ?How does one recover from quiet? what does that mean? is it maybe a case where you play a different character for a while?

### Burning Paradox

  when reality rolls opportunities, a mage has the chance to burn off their highest paradox die by paying a PP to burn off their highest paradox die as a weird complication that will generally last for the rest of the session. 

  If reality rolls more then one opportunity the Mage must step up their complication once for each additional opportunity. 

  [it's not uncommon for a 1 to get rolled, so mages should have a good chance to burn off paradox, but it like the slight negative disincentive for stepping up the complication for each opportunity rolled]  

  You can burn your highest die even if it's currently in a reality dice pool. This doesn't affect reality's total or anything. The complication will come after the feat is resolved.
