# Working Magick

  Magick is a change, any change, in reality you make through an effort of your Enlightened Will. This change is called a *feat.* 
  
  It is possible to accomplish anything through Magick, but the larger and more complex your feat, the more dice Reality will have to resist you, and their are consequences to failing.
  
  Because magick is an expression of your will, it requires a conscious choice by the Mage. 

  If you can describe your feat and how you with accomplish it within the context of your magickal *practice* you may add dice from your mundane traits, and not just your magickal ones. 
  
  > For example, if your practice is witchcraft you might describe collecting some physical token of your victim and creating a poppet with it which you poke with needles. Describing your effect in terms of your practice in this way will allow you to add your Mental and Occult traits.

  Mages occasionally perform feats with pure will and nothing else. Such Raw Magick transcends your focus and allows you to affect change without needing to follow the patterns and strictures of your practice. It is quicker and simpler, but more dangerous and difficult becuase only the Mystickal traits, Arete and Spheres, can be used. 

## Feats and Workings
  
  A feat is magick you accomplish in a single action. 

  A working is a collection of feats unified into a single magickal accomplishment. It might be a lone mage's project done slowly feat by feat, or a single spell woven by an entire cabal. 
  
  A feat may take an entire scene to complete, or it might be instantaneous, it might even grant you multiple actions in a single round, but those will be mundane actions. You may only attempt one feat per round. 

  A simple feat may have just one effect, like dealing damage with a bolt of flame, but complex feats may have as many different effects as you wish. For example, your bolt of fire might deal immediate damage but also complicate the life or your target by burning away their false skin to reveal the android beneith. 

  Each effect is represented by an *effect die* and you choose how many, and how large, the effect dice of your feat will be.

### Effect Dice

  Pick your Effect Dice. 
  
  These may be any number of dice of any size, you may choose an effect die larger then d12 by adding additional dice to that effect. The larger an Effect Die the grander the scope and power of your spell. 

  If you wish to affect more then one target assign each an Effect Die. 

  Successes | Effect Dice | Feat       | Examples
  :--------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:---------
  1         | d4          | Trivial    | 
  2         | d6          | Typical    | 
  3         | d8          | Difficult  | 
  4         | d10         | Impressive | 
  5         | d12         | Mighty     | 
  6         | d12,d4      | Outlandish |
  7         | d12,d6      |            |
  10        | 2d12        | Godlike    |
  20        | 4d12        |            |

  Table: Effect Die rating

## Spheres

  Once your feat is clearly defined we'll determine how difficult it is by determining its Sphere components. That is, which Spheres, and at which size, best represent the feat as you have described it.
 
  > For example: You need to cross a gap between two building to escape some technocratic agents. You might calculate the coordinates of the rooftop you wish to be on and run a quick script on your wrist computer to alter your token's position in the virtual reality simulation that is reality; effectively teleporting across the distance. This accomplishes your feat using Technology and the sphere of Correspondence.   

  > Alternately: You might speek a spell that calls upon the mystic winds of watoomb to levitate you across the gap. Making use of your Occult skill and the Sphere of Forces. 
  
  It is possible for your Effect to have multiple components of the same Sphere. This is especially common with Corrispondence and Prime because those Spheres are used for common meta-magickal components. Such as targeting and extending the duration of your feats. 
  
  > For example, if you combine a d8 fire attack with a d8 levitation asset, you are controlling two distinct Forces which requires two d8 Forces components.
  
  Dice | Ability      | Description
  ----:|:------------:|:-----------
  d4   | Perception   | Observe and perceive elements of this Sphere beyond any mortal ken. 
  d6   | Manipulation | Make small changes to existing elements of this Sphere.
  d8   | Control      | Create noticeable effects with elements of this Sphere. This rank is generally for an effect to cause damage. 
  d10  | Command      | Create major effects. This rank is typically required to cause significant changes to the patterns of others.  
  d12  | Mastery      | Command vast effects with the elements of this Sphere.
  
  Table: Generic Sphere Ratings

### Meta-magick 

  Some sphere components extend the possibilities of your feat instead of directly realating to your effect. These we refer to generally as Meta-magick. The two most common forms are using the Corrispondence sphere for targeting your feat and Prime for extending the duration of it.

  Meta-magick components are not required, but when used, they are separte instances of that sphere.

#### Targeting

  Without extra effort the effects of magick are localized to the mage and their most immediate environment. However, by adding a Correspondence component it is possible to make a feat reach a target or location at any distance. With the addition of Spirit the feat can reach into other worlds as well. 

  Targeting with Correspondence can be a matter of pure distance, but it can also take the form of reaching the target through something closely realted to them. The classic "spell upon a lock of their hair" is an example of relational Correspondence from the practice of Witchcraft. 

  Range targeting allows for vast distances but even if you have the ability to target anywhere on earth you must be able to indentify a particular target. This can be done with line of sight unaided by mundane effects such as cameras or telescopes (mystick effects that match your focus may help), or by knowing in great detail where your target is at this exact momement. Without one of those things, you will need to use realational targeting instead. 

  With realational targeting you must possess some object that has a concrete relation to your target. Providing you can touch and hold this object you may attempt to channel your feat through it and at your target. 

  Dice    | Range (Correspondence)         | Relation (Correspondence) 
  -------:|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------
  None    | Touch to immediate vicinity    | Yourself. 
  d4      | Within a neighborhood          | A fresh body sample of your target.
  d6      | Within a large city            | A boon companion. A meaningful posession of your target. 
  d8      | Within a state                 | A casual friend. A posession of your target. 
  d10     | Within a large country         | A casual aquantaince. A object your target touched.  
  d12     | Within a continent             | Distance. One trivial kind of relation. These are the same color object. We are both human.
  d12, d6 | Anywhere on earth              | No object, only a concept that relates to your target.

  Table: Targeting Magick by Distance or Relation with Correspondence

  Dice    | Extra-dimensionality (Spirit) 
  -------:|:---------------------------
  None    | Only the Mage's current locality and beings manifest upon it.
  d4      | Non-manifest spirits who've crossed into the current locality.
  d6      | 
  d8      | 
  d10     | 
  d12     | 
  d12, d6 | 

  Table: Targeting Spirits and other Dimensions with Spirit

#### Duration

  Magick may have long lasting consequences, but reality will relentlessly errode active magick unless you constantly support it with Quintessence.

  Without support a feat lasts a short while, typically no more then the length of your action, but if you spend a point of Quintessnce the feat will endure for the length of a scene. 
  
  Alternately, you may use the Sphere of Prime to fuel your magick from universal energy of creation and make it last longer then a moment.

  Dice    | Duration (Prime)
  -------:|:-----------------
  None    | Only a moment
  d4      | A few moments
  d6      | An Hour
  d8      | A Week
  d10     | A Season
  d12     | A year and a day
  d12, d6 | Beyond a year
  d12, d8 | Typically lasts unless dispelled

  Table: Extending the duration of magick with Prime  

#### Other Meta-effects

  Using a pattern sphere to tether a feat to someone or something. 
  
  Using Time to create a delayed effect feat. 

  Using Mind to give your feat judgement about who or what to affect.  

## Casting Time

  Your practice will often dictate how long it takes to perform Magick.
  But if you attempt to go faster then your practice dictates, your haste grant reality extra dice to resist you.

  Dice    | Time
  -------:|:----------
  None    | All the time you desire.
  d4      | A day. 
  d6      | An hour.
  d8      | The length of a scene. Minutes.
  d10     | Two full actions. tens of seconds.
  d12     | A single action. Seconds
  d12, d8 | No time. You can also take a full mundane action. [Or d12, d12? or something more then d8]


### Focused Magick Dice Pool

  - Attribute
    - Based upon your focus and your effect
  - Skill
    - Based upon your focus and effect
    - Can include specialty dice
  - Distinction
    - Especially a Tradition can help or hinder workings
    - Scene distinctions can also help or hinder
  - Arete
    - If you spend Quintessence, you may include your Arete trait an  additional time for each point of Quintessence
  - Spheres
    - Include the dice from all the Spheres involved in the effect, especially  d4s
    - Additional Sphere traits cannot be added with PP
  - Assets
    - Mundane assets such wand or sword must relate to your Focus. Perhaps by   being of historical significance
    - Resonance is a mystic asset which you can use if it relates to your   Effect
  - Complications
    - The scene, or the target of your effect may have a complication friendly  to your Focus or Effect which you can include in your dice pool
  - Time
    - If you spend extra time performing your working
    - The demands of your focal instruments may affect what's possible here.


## Raw Magick

  Raw magick is an instantaneous working of pure will that transcends all of your beliefs about reality. It is often a desperate Mage's last resort because it is difficult and dangerous. 
  
  You can use only your Mystickal traits when working Raw Magick which means fewer dice and a greater chance of failure. On the other hand, the *Effect* of Raw Magick is not bound by your practice and requires no instruments or preparation.  

### Raw Magick Dice Pool

  - Arete
    - You may spend Quintessence of any kind of a raw working
  - Spheres
    - Include the dice from all the Spheres involved in the effect, even if   they are d4
    - Additional Sphere traits cannot be added with PP
  - Assets
    - Resonance is a mystic asset which you can use if it relates to your   Effect
  - Time
    - If you spend extra time performing your working



  How long you take to achieve your working.
  
  Trait | Casting Time
  -----:|-------------
  d4    | No time. You can also take a mundane action before or after this
  d6    | Takes the length of your action. Pass the initiative
  d8    | Takes this action and your next one
  d10   | Takes the length of this scene
  d12   | Takes longer than this scene

## Reality Resists Your Working

  Once you've rolled to create your effect, Reality will oppose you with a dice pool that's composed based on the effect you are attempting to create.

### Reality Dice Pool

  - The Size of your Effect (d6 or larger)
    - This can be a single Effect larger than d12
      - For example, a d12,d6 Effect could take out someone in a single action but Reality will get a d12 and a d6 to resist
    - It can also be multiple Effects
      - if needed, you can declare several different Effects
        - Reality gets to add all of them
  - The Level of Sphere effects you are attempting
    - From d4 to d12.
    - A Life 3 Effect would be a d8. A Prime 5, Mind 5 Effect would be 2d12.
    - Duration is a Prime effect
    - Range is a Correspondence effect
  - The scope of the effect
    - From d4 to d12 or more
  - Paradox
    - Reality can spend dice from a mage's paradox to add to it's pool to resist a working
    - And can optionally pay the affected mage a PP per die to keep them

## Outcomes

  For Coincidental workings Reality gets 2 dice for it's total.

  For Vulgar workings Reality gets 3 dice for it's total and you'll get an extra d6 Paradox regardless of whether your working succeeds or fails.

  If you meet or beat reality's total your working is a success. Otherwise, your effect dice gets added to your paradox pool, and perhaps greater retribution if paradox burns off.

## Resisting workings, targeting sleepers or other awakened

  > some notes to make here. Need to clean up the correspondence and prime vs. just strait up duration traits. So that it's clear how to make an effect. 
  > also, need to workout what happens when you target someone. 
  > I think this right now: if you target a sleeper, they can't resist with magic. They can maybe resist with mundane traits, based on your effect, but that's it. As a mage you have to beat both reality and their resistance? or maybe not. Maybe you can just blurgh sleepers all you want? 
  > if you target someone with magick though, they can add their arete and avatar rating, which now becomes a trait, to reality's dice pool. or maybe just avatar? eitherway, they are harder to effect, and if they detect your working they can work their own countermagick which allows them to roll a full magickal counter?
  > then what? the main issue here is do we add to reality's dice pool, or do we all for a second resistance roll that you must also beat? Either one is possible, but which is easier?
  > if its a second roll, like, someone could still roll to dodge the physical manifestation of your spell? I don't like that. but if we just add to reality's pool...the main thing to ask is how avatar and arete actualyl work. logically, not mechanically. the more you know about how magick works in the SETTING the easier these kinds of questions are to answer. Therefore, as a mage you can resist a working directed at you with your avatar. And various sanctums traits and such for your location. If you are aware of the working and resist it, you can add your arete. If you practice some countermagick based on your correct
  > Counter-magick is page 546 in the m20 book
  > from their perspective, if you successfully create a fireball you still have to hit someone with it. 
  > which I am dubious about. 
  > thats two rolls for the same thing. and, if your working includes, say, shoot for shooting, then there's no need to make a second attack roll, but...and this is a but, it may be that they can dodge your physical attack if they can see it coming. Which does kinda mean that they get a chance to make a roll to beat your total. just like reality does. eh, there are worse things. 
  > be free with information to the players. There's no need to hide things. With Cortex plus it will all even out. 
  > which says to me, that you can dodge physical effects maybe, you can also resist magic if you have an avatar and some arete.  Avatar is always added. 
  > I wonder if you could thus, mundanely resist mind control? that's what willpower was suppose to be for. 
  > 

## Ritual Workings

  \[draft\] If two mages have compatible paradigms they can cooperate on a working with a greater chance of success.

  For ritual workings, I think you can pool your sphere dice together. And perhaps Arete? Probably. You can pool your Raw magick dice and get greater chance of success, but of course, if there's paradox involved, it will apply to every mage in the working.

## Summary

  Describe the narrative effect you want and decide the Effect dice, Duration, Range, and Scope, then roll your Magick dice pool.

  - Magick Dice Pool. Arete, the Spheres needed for the effect, and a Casting Time die for how long you take to work the effect.

  - Your two highest dice are you total. (Your Effect die comes from your initial choice, not from your dice pool)

  - Opportunities you roll can be activated to add/step up your Paradox; or to trigger a backlash complication.

  Then Reality rolls a reaction against your working using: your Effect dice the level of the Spheres required for the effect, and the Duration, Range and Scope you decided upon.

  - If there are Sleeper witnesses Reality can add a die from d6 to d12 depending on how many there are and how rigid their sense of reality is.

  - If your working is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total.

  - If your working is Coincidental Reality only gets 2 for it's total and Sleepers can be used as an Asset.

  - Opportunities can be activated to trigger a Paradox backlash of your own choice.

  If your total meets or beats reality's your effect is successful and you can apply your Effect dice to your targets.

  If you fail, your effect dice get added to your Paradox or trigger a backlash that may draw in more of your existing Paradox.
