# Making a Mage

## Concept

*Describe who your Mage is in five words or so.*

You may have lived as a mystick most of your life, or you might be a barely woken innocent, but your power is nothing without beliefs and those comes from fundamental elements of yourself. What are those fundamental elements of you?

## Avatar

*Pick an Essence (Dynamic, Pattern, Primordial, or Questing) for your avatar and characterize it a bit.*

*Avatar rating starts at 1 and may be bought as high as 5 with Character Dice. Avatar 2 costs 1d6, 3 costs 2d6, 4 costs 4d6, 5 costs 8d6.*

There is something different about you. You have a spiritual guide. Some call it an oversoul, a spark of divinity, a guardian angel, a loa, a genius, or even a familiar. This is your Avatar and it came to you one dark night to led you towards answers you didn't have the words to ask for. It showed you that your beliefs have the power change reality. It showed you how to make Magick.

For some mages their Avatar is a subtle nudge or intuition, for other's it's a powerful fully embodied entity.

Avatar is a mystickal narrative rating, but not a die trait.

As a rating, it's how much personal Quintessence you can hold and how much Quintessence from any source you can spend on a single magickal action.

## Focus

*Pick a Paradigm, at least one Magickal practice, and 7 Instruments*

What does the mage believe? = paradigm

How does the mage turn belief into action? = practice

What does the mage use in that practice? = instruments

All combined = focus.

## Attributes
*Assign d6, d8, d10 to three Attribute| Physical, Mental, Social.*

Attributes are mundane traits representing general faculties.

They are the base of most any action.

## Distinctions

*Pick a Tradition as a Distinction, and 3 more.*

Distinctions are mundane traits that can either help or hinder a Mage's actions. They can be relationships, affiliations, personality, or unique backgrounds.

An appropriate Distinction can be helpful as a d8, or a detriment as a d4 and you get a Plot Point. Helpful or Hurtful is your choice.

Only one of your appropriate Distinctions can be added to an action pool, unless you pay a PP to add a second appropriate Distinction.

## Skills

*All skills start at 'Untrained' d4. Spend Character Dice to advance them up to 'Master' d12.*

Skills are mundane traits that represent distinct areas of expertise and training.

Most actions will have an obviously applicable skill, but you can spend a PP to add a second appropriate skill to an action pool.

### Specialties

*Spend Character Dice to add Specialties to a Skill up to d12.*

Each skill is intentionally broad. Specialties represent more focused knowledge and training. A Specialty is less likely to be useful, but when it is, you can add it to your action pool along with the Skill it specializes.

You can only have one Specialty for each Skill in your action pool, but if you pay a PP you can add a second applicable Specialty from a Skill already added.

Skill              | Description
------------------:|:-------
**Academics**     | Mundane areas of knowledge such as history and literature.
**Art**           | Creating art and optionally, expressing a truth through it.
**Athletics**     | Running, swimming, catching, throwing, acrobatics. That kind of thing.
**Cosmology**     | Knowledge of other worlds, dimensions, and planes of being; their inhabitants, and how to navigate them.
**Craft**         | Build and repair things.
**Drive**         | Drive various vehicles.
**Etiquette**     | Social grace and fitting in with various human groups.
**Fight**         | Hand to hand and melee weapons.
**Focus**         | Relax, center, breath.
**Influence**     | Empathy, intimidation, seduction, leadership, expression.
**Investigation** | Investigation and research.
**Occult**        | The history and practices of mystick traditions. A useful default skill for many kinds of mystick actions.
**Science**       | Scientific disciplines and modern medicine.
**Shoot**         | Ranged weapons.

## Arete

*Arete starts at 'Sleep Walker' d4. You may spend Character Dice to increase it up to d12.*

Arete is a mystick trait that represents your mystick will and enlightenment.

It's the core of your ability to affect reality and is the base trait for any magickal action.

You can spend Quintessence, not Plot Points, to add your Arete trait to a magickal action more than once.

Arete also determined how free you are from the Instruments of your Focus. For every step of Arete above d6, 1 of your required Instruments becomes optional.

## Spheres

*Each starts at 'Inexperienced' d4. Spend Character Dice to increase your Spheres. No sphere can be higher then your Arete.*

The nine Spheres are mystick traits that represent your experience and ability affecting a specific facet of reality.

Each magickal Effect will be broken down into the one or more Spheres required to cause it depending on what parts of reality it disrupts and you'll add your Sphere trait for all of the appropriate Spheres. You can't use PP to add additional Sphere traits.

Sphere               | Description
--------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------
**Correspondence**  | Understanding of the connections between places, spaces, and things.
**Entropy**         | Study of mortality, probability, and chaos.
**Forces**          | Command over elemental energies.
**Life**            | Influence over organic beings and the physical structures of living bodies.
**Matter**          | Control of inert materials, objects, and solid elemental structures.
**Mind**            | Influence over emotions and thoughts, including the ability to project consciousness from oneâ€™s physical body.
**Prime**           | Control over primordial energies.
**Spirit**          | Contact with Otherworldly spaces and entities.
**Time**            | Perception of, and influence over, temporal states and time-based phenomena.

## Backgrounds

*A Mage starts with no Backgrounds, but can spend Character Dice to buy them.*

Backgrounds can be mundane or mystickal and represent extra assets and benefits the character may enjoy.

Many of them are advantages that are external to the character and can't be developed after the game starts. Backgrounds can also be negatively affected narratively.

Some Backgrounds can be shared by the cabal meaning each mage can contributes any number of Character Dice to it and they are pooled together to determine the size of the trait. Shared backgrounds with more then 8 Character Dice invested use the \[\[Traits beyond d12\]\] rule.

Background    | Description
-------------:|:-----------
**Allies, Contacts, Backup, Gang, Cult, Servants, Spies, Retainers**| These might be magickal constructs who do your dishes and laundry, a cult of fanatic but mortal worshippers who do your bidding without question, a coven of other Mages you have a friendly relationship with, or it might simply be a mortal friend who work for the DMV.  
**Arcane** | Gives a Mage a mystic aura that makes them hard to find, detect, and even remember. Arcane can be used for stealth actions but also for just about any attempt to avoid detection including by electronic devices. It also means that the Mage will fade away from recording devices and the memories of beings. The larger the trait the faster and more completely it will happen.
**Chantry**| A permanent base of operations for a group of Mages. Usually positioned on or near a Node. Which is a separate Trait.
**Demesne** | Personal inner-dream realm.
**Dreaming** | You can tap into a well of mundane knowledge. Once per session you can turn your Dreaming die into any mundane skill or specialty that you wish and use it as such for the rest of the session.
**Fame, Influence, Rank** | You have recognition or power in the mundane world.
**Familiar, Companion** | Familiars are quite useful. You have to feed them Quintessence regularly, but they can eat your paradox and also help you with mundane and sometimes mystickal tasks.
**Library** | You have a collection of materials, commonly books, that can help you advance your mystick traits or research other magickal topics.
**Mentor** | You have a relationship with a more experienced Mage who provides you some guidance and training.
**Node** | A Node is a place where Quintessence collects. Nodes have a Resonance which affects the flavor of their energies and especially the physical form of Tass produced from that Node. A Node can hold at most 1 Quintessence per d6 invested. The Node's Quintessence will regenerate in full each week. Generally a Node's Quintessence will simply wait to be absorbed, but on rare occasions some amount of it will discharge into a physical form called Tass that can be stored or carried by a Mage, while the unbound Quintessence of the Node regenerates. Mage's skilled in Prime and Matter or Prime and Life can perform workings to coax Quintessence from a Node into Tass and so create a stock pile of magickal energies.
**Patron** | Someone in a position of power who has an interest in helping you.
**Resources** | You have mundane wealth.
**Sanctum** | A permanent place, sometimes in a chantry, that is aligned to your Focus instead of the Consensus. A Sanctum makes magick based on your Focus consequential and is essential for extended workings.
**Status** | Favored position among other Mages.
**Wonders** | Magical items

## Character Dice

You'll get Xd6 to spend on your Mage's traits where 2d6 = 1d8, 2d8 = 1d10, 2d10 = 1d12.

The cost for a die increases exponentially.

Number of dice generally in multiples of 8? 24, 32, 40? Something like that.

**Cost (d6)**  |  **Die**
--------------- | ---------
1/2 | d4
1   | d6
2   | d8
4   | d10
8   | d12

### Traits beyond d12

Some traits allow you to invest more than 8 Character Dice. Extra points are applied to a second die for that trait.

**Cost (d6)**  | **Dice**
---------------| ----------
9  | d12, d6
10 | d12, d8
12 | d12, d10
16 | d12, d12
