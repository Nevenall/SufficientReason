# Working Magick

  Magick is a broad term for creating changes in reality through an effort of your Enlightened Will. Such an effort is called a *feat* or a *working.*
  
  It is possible to accomplish any change with Magick but the larger and more complex a feat you attempt the more dice Reality will have to resist your action.
 
  ## The Basis of Magick
 
  Magick is an expression of your Enlightened Will, therefore it requires a conscious choice to employ. 
  
  Your Enlightened Will and your ability to channel Quintessence is tied to your avatar. 

## The Power of your Practice

  If you can describe how you accomplish your feat within the context of your magickal *practice* you may add dice from your mundane traits in addition to your magickal ones. 
  
  > For example: if your practice is witchcraft you might collect some physical token from your victim and create a poppet you can poke. Going through the effort of accomplishing your feat in terms of your practice allows you to add your Mental and Occult traits.

## Raw Magick

  It is possible to perform a feat with pure Will and nothing else. *Raw Magick* transcends your *focus* and allows you to affect changes without the strictures of your practice. It is quicker and simpler, but more dangerous and difficult because only the Mystick traits (Arete and Spheres) can be used. 

## Feats and Workings
  
  A feat is magick you accomplish in a single action. 

  A working is a collection of feats unified into a single magickal accomplishment. It might be a lone mage's project done slowly season by season, or a single spell woven by an entire cabal. 
  
  A feat may take an entire scene to complete, or it might be instantaneous, it might even grant you multiple actions in a single round, but those will be mundane actions. You may only attempt one feat per round. 

### Feats have One or More Effects

  A simple feat may have just one effect, like dealing damage with a bolt of flame, but complex feats may have as many different effects as you wish. 
  
  > For example, you create a life feat to give yourself claws d8 and armor d8.  

  Each effect is represented by an *effect die* and you choose how many, and how large, the effect dice of your feat will be.

### Effect Dice

  Pick your Effect Dice, the larger they are the grander and more powerful the scope of your spell. You may choose effect dice of any size and number. 
  
  To affect more then one target assign each an Effect Die. 

  Successes | Effect Dice | Feat       | Examples
  :--------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:---------
  1         | d4          | Trivial    | 
  2         | d6          | Typical    | 
  3         | d8          | Difficult  | 
  4         | d10         | Impressive | 
  5         | d12         | Mighty     | 
  6         | d12,d4      | Outlandish |
  7         | d12,d6      |            |
  10        | 2d12        | Godlike    |
  20        | 4d12        |            |

  Table: Effect Die rating

## Spheres

  Once your feat is clearly defined we'll determine how complex it is by determining its Sphere components. That is, what ratings of which Spheres your feat will require.

  > For example: You need to cross a gap between two building to escape some technocratic agents. You might calculate the coordinates of the rooftop you wish to be on and run a quick script on your wrist computer to alter your token's position in the virtual reality simulation that is reality; effectively teleporting across the distance. This would accomplish your feat using the sphere of Correspondence at d8. 

  > Alternately: You might speak a spell that calls upon mystick winds to levitate you across the gap. Making use of the Sphere of Forces at d8. 
  
  It is possible for your Effect to have multiple components of the same Sphere. This is especially common with Correspondence and Prime because those Spheres are used for common meta-magickal components. Such as targeting and extending the duration of your feats. 
  
  > For example, if you combine a d8 fire attack with a d8 levitation asset, you are controlling two distinct Forces which requires two d8 Forces components.
  
  Dice | Ability      | Description
  ----:|:------------:|:-----------
  d4   | Perception   | Observe and perceive elements of this Sphere beyond any mortal ken. 
  d6   | Manipulation | Make small chanzges to existing elements of this Sphere.
  d8   | Control      | Create noticeable effects with elements of this Sphere. This rank is generally for an effect to cause damage. 
  d10  | Command      | Create major effects. This rank is typically required to cause significant changes to the patterns of others.  
  d12  | Mastery      | Command vast effects with the elements of this Sphere.
  
  Table: Generic Sphere Ratings

### Meta-magick 

  Some sphere components extend the possibilities of your feat instead of directly relating to your effect and we refer to these as meta-magick. The two most common are Correspondence to target your feat and Prime to extend the duration of it.

  Meta-magick components are not required, but they are always separate sphere components.

#### Targeting

  By default a feat is localized to you and your immediate environment, but by adding a Correspondence component  it can reach a distant target or location. With the addition of Spirit your feat can reach into other worlds as well. 

  Targeting with Correspondence can be a matter of distance or, reaching a target through something closely related to them. 
  
  > The use of a "lock of hair" is a classic example of relational Correspondence from the practice of Witchcraft. 

  Range targeting allows for vast distances but even if you have the ability to target anywhere on earth you must be able to identify a particular target. This can be done with line of sight unaided by mundane effects such as cameras or telescopes (mystick effects that match your focus may help), or by knowing in great detail where your target is at this exact moment. Without one of those things, you will need to use relational targeting instead. 

  With relational targeting you must possess something with a relation to your target which you'll use to channel your feat at your target. 

  Dice    | Range (Correspondence)         | Relation (Correspondence) 
  -------:|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------
  None    | Touch to immediate vicinity    | Yourself. 
  d4      | Within a neighborhood          | A fresh body sample of your target.
  d6      | Within a large city            | A boon companion. A meaningful possession of your target. 
  d8      | Within a state                 | A casual friend. A possession of your target. 
  d10     | Within a large country         | A casual acquaintance. A object your target once touched.  
  d12     | Within a continent             | A distant relation
  d12, d4 | Within a hemisphere            | 
  d12, d6 | Anywhere on earth              | No object, only a concept that relates to your target.

  Table: Targeting Magick by Distance or Relation with Correspondence

  Dice    | Extra-dimensionality (Spirit) 
  -------:|:---------------------------
  None    | Only the Mage's current locality and beings manifest upon it.
  d4      | Non-manifest spirits who've crossed into the current locality.
  d6      |  
  d8      | 
  d10     | 
  d12     | 
  d12, d4 |
  d12, d6 | 

  Table: Targeting Spirits and other Dimensions with Spirit

#### Duration

  Reality relentlessly erodes active magick unless you constantly support it with Quintessence.

  A feat lasts a short while, typically no more then the length of your action, but if you spend a point of Quintessence the effects will endure for the length of a scene.

  Alternately, you may use the Sphere of Prime to fuel your feat from universal energy of creation.

  Dice    | Duration (Prime)
  -------:|:-----------------
  None    | Only a moment
  d4      | A few moments
  d6      | An Hour
  d8      | Several Hours
  d10     | A Week
  d12     | A Season
  d12, d4 | A year and a day
  d12, d6 | Beyond a year
  d12, d12| Until dispelled or destroyed

  Table: Extending the duration of magick with Prime  

#### Other Meta-effects

  Use a pattern sphere to tether a feat to a pattern.

  > For example: Use Life to tie an effect to a person so it will follow them around.  
  
  Use Time to create a feat with delayed effect. 

  Use Mind to give your feat judgement about who or what to affect.  

## (draft section) Casting Time

  Your practice will dictate how long it takes to perform most feats, but you can give reality more dice to resist you if you attempt to finishing faster. 

  Dice    | Time
  -------:|:----------
  None    | All the time you desire.
  d4      | A day. 
  d6      | An hour.
  d8      | The length of a scene. Minutes.
  d10     | Two full actions. tens of seconds.
  d12     | A single action. Seconds
  d12, d8 | No time. You can also take a full mundane action. [Or d12, d12? or something more then d8]

## Realities & Localities 

  There are no neutral spaces in the Ascension war and most places are closely aligned to the technocratic consensus.  
  
  Locality is a trait representing how strongly aligned a place is with it's ruling reality and consequently, how strongly reality will resist your workings within it.
  
### Sanctums and Demesnes

  To aid their workings mages sometimes find or build localities that are friendly to their focus. 

  - If your effect die does not exceed the locality die, the effect can be considered coincidental.
  - Reality gets no extra locality die.

  localities do not add dice to magickal actions, on

### Technocratic Localities

  Technocratic localities tend to express technology, modernity, and globalization. The more hypermodern and related to globalized western power structures the stronger the locality.

  Dice  | Locality (Technocratic)
  -----:|:-------------
  d4    | A mundane place friendly to your practice      
  d6    | Typical western/globalized area
  d8    | Sprawl, suburbs, most urban areas
  d10   | Urban core, skyscraper  
  d12   | Science lab, stock exchange floor, ultra modern/smart building
  
  Table: Technocratic Locality

### Wyld Localities

  The Wyld is an inhuman reality. It's the power and terror of a natural world that is actively hostile to humanity. Wyld is a reality commonly associated with the Garou.

  Dice  | Locality (Wyld)
  -----:|:-------------
  d4    | A mundane place friendly to your practice
  d6    | Urban park
  d8    | A campground
  d10   | Deep wilderness
  d12   | Untouched wilderness
  
  Table: Wyld Locality

## Magickal Actions

  - Clearly define your feat. What you will do and how you will do it
    - Pick your effect dice
    - Break your feat into sphere components
    - Assemble your dice pool, roll and determine your total
      - Opportunities you roll will grant PP and generate paradox for you, or flaws in your magick
  - Reality assembles it's dice pool and rolls to resist your efforts
    - 

### Focused Magick Dice Pool

  If your feat clearly flows from your mystick practice it is focused magick. Focused magick requires instruments, but allows you to use more dice.

  - Attribute
    - Include one Attribute based upon the instruments you are using
    - If you can justify it based on your instruments you may include another attributes by spending a PP  
  - Skill
    - Include one Skill based upon the instruments you are using 
      - Occult is commonly used for Mystick practices 
    - If you can justify it based on your instruments you may include another Skill by spending a PP  
    - You may include one appropriate Specialty from any Skill already in your pool
    - If you can justify it based on your instruments you may include another Specialty by spending a PP
  - Distinction
    - Traditions especially can help or hinder
    - Scene distinctions can also help or hinder
    - Resonance is a mystick distinction that a scene, location, tass might possess which can help or hinder particular kinds of magick
  - Arete
    - Include your Arete
    - You may add your Arete again if you spend a point of Quintessence
      - You may do this as many times as your Avatar rating
  - Spheres
    - Include each Sphere that is a part of your feat, only once
    - Additional Spheres cannot be added with PP or Quintessence
  - Assets
    - You may be able to include one Asset 
    - Mundane assets might help you in focusing your will to perform magick
    - Mystick assets, especially resonance, might help you in your feat
    - When using mundane assets as instruments you may be able to include them if they are extraordinary
      - for example, by being of great historical significance or possessing resonance
  - Complications
    - The scene, or your target, may have a complication helpful to your feat

### Raw Magick Dice Pool

  Raw magick is an instantaneous working of pure will that transcends all of your beliefs about reality. It is often a desperate Mage's last resort because it is difficult and dangerous. 
  
  You can use only your Mystickal traits when working Raw Magick which means fewer dice and a greater chance of failure. On the other hand, the *Effect* of Raw Magick is not bound by your practice and requires no instruments or preparation.  

  - Arete
    - Include your Arete
    - You may add your Arete again if you spend a point of Quintessence
      - You may do this as many times as your Avatar rating
  - Spheres
    - Include each Sphere that is a part of your feat, only once
    - Additional Spheres cannot be added with PP or Quintessence
  - Assets
    - You may be able to include one Asset 
    - Mystick assets, especially resonance, might help you in your feat

### Flaws and Consequences

  The most common way for reality to bleed off the tension of being forcibly changed is when 1s are rolled on a magickal action. These opportunities can be activated to represent either the unintended consequences of a spell, or reality weaving flaws into a working. 

  > For example, a fire spell may reasonably set unintended things on fire D8, because of some opportunities. A reflex enhancing life spell may require the target to 'eat frequently d6' to prevent the spell from fading.
  
  When an opportunity is rolled on a magickal action, the mage gets a PP and some kind of d6 complication. The complication can be stepped up by using extra opportunities, or additional complications can be created. 

  These complications can be quite varied, but reality's favorite tactic is to punish mages with its own scientific paradigm. 

  ?
  can opportunities rolled by mages also just add directly to their paradox if there's no particularly interesting consequences to be had? Maybe, but that would return some of that decision making to the gm. Of course, if the gm can't think of anything...mmm...
  ?

### Reality Resists Your Magick

  Once you've rolled for your feat, Reality will oppose you with a dice pool based on your effect dice and the Sphere components of your feat.
  
  - Locality
    - Includes a place's locality trait
  - Effect Dice
    - Includes the effect dice from your feat
  - Sphere components
    - Includes the Sphere components of your feat
    - May include the same Sphere multiple times
  - Paradox
    - Reality can spend dice from your paradox and add them to it's pool to resist your feat
    - This may even be paradox generated by opportunities you created when rolling for your feat
    - Optionally, reality may pay you a PP per die to keep the paradox it used, otherwise they are permanently spent

  If your feat is Coincidental Reality gets 2 dice for it's total.

  If your feat is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total [and you will get an extra d6 Paradox regardless of whether your feat succeeds or fails.]

### Outcomes

  If reality fails to beat your total by at least 1 your feat is a success. Otherwise, your effect dice gets added to your paradox pool, and perhaps greater retribution if paradox burns off.

## Paradox
  
  Paradox is an expression of reality's resistance to being manipulated by the awakened. It accumulates as a Complication which hinders workings; it weaves its way into spells as flaws and unintended consequences; and sometimes paradox explodes in a reality bending backlash against a mage that can scar, twist, or trap them in a bubble of strange reality known as Quiet. 

  Paradox can be generated only when an enlightened will is invoked to affect changes in reality. It's created in the smallest way from spoilers rolled on magickal actions, and in a more serious way from attempting vulgar magick, but the most dangerous cause of paradox is failing a magickal action.

### The Paradox Complication

  Each mage has a single complication which represents their personal accumulation of paradox, growing and waiting to discharge.
  
#### Detecting Paradox

  The size of a mage's Paradox complication can be detected with a Prime 1 effect.

#### Paradox Hinders Magick

  When resisting a mage's workings reality adds that mage's Paradox complication to it's dice pool.

  If mage's are performing a group working, each mage is responsible for a part of the overall effect and each mage will be resisted separately. 

#### Gaining Paradox

  When reality resists a feat, set your paradox complication equal to the size of effect dice you attempted. If the effect die is equal to or less than your current paradox, step up your paradox instead. 

  When you attempt vulgar magick in front of sleeper witnesses, your paradox is stepped up once regardless of whether your feat succeeds or fails. 

  Attempting vulgar magick without sleeper witnesses doesn't automatically earn your paradox, but it is still dangerous. 

#### Losing Paradox

  There are some ways to help deal with paradox. A familiar can share the burden with a mage, or a Prime effect can be used to trigger a paradox backlash in a controlled environment. But there are no known ways of removing or avoiding paradox. 

  Paradox will continue to build up until it all discharges in a single event known as a backlash. 

### Backlash

  A backlash is a discharge that rends at the fabric of a mage's being. When it occurs all of a mage's accumulated paradox energy suddenly pours into their pattern in a cascade that either marks them with a weird or traps them in the dreaded quiet. 

  Reality can be strangely capricious about when exactly a backlash occurs. They can happen any time, but usually happen at the worst possible moments; such as when a mage's working was resisted and they've suddenly accumulated a significant amount of paradox.

  There are four possible effects of a backlash. When one happens you must choose two of the effects to inflict upon your mage. Many of them can be chosen twice with increasingly serious consequences.

#### Burn

  When the energies of a paradox course through your pattern and injure your flesh, it's call burn. 
  
  Turn your paradox complication in a physical harm complication. 
  
  If you choose burn twice, instead take a permanent d6 physical complication, or step up an existing one. This physical complication is also a mystick trait. It represents a scar in your metaphysical being and cannot be healed. It will persist however else you might change your life pattern.  

  If a harm complication is larger then d12 you will face death.

#### Permanent Paradox

  Sometimes paradox permanently invades your pattern and grows there like a cancer, twisting your being into a nightmarish offense to reality.

  Take a d6 permanent paradox complication, or step up your existing one. This counts as two choices.

  You now always have a paradox complication from which to begin accumulating more. When you experience backlash, it's at your current level, but instead of removing all paradox, you return to the level of your permanent trait. 

  If your permanent paradox ever exceeds d12 your mage looses protagonist status and becomes an NPC. 

#### Weirds

  Often paradox will mark you in ways that make it difficult to pass for mortal like spoiling milk and wilting plants in your presence, or causing you to vomit snakes wherever you attempt to speak a lie. These strange effects are called weirds, and many of them have become a familiar part of magick even in the larger sleeper culture. All the better to make a mage as different and dangerous.

  Turn your paradox complication into a weird complication that will last until you can activate enough opportunities to remove it. 

  If you choose this twice, instead take a permanent d6 weird, or step up an existing one.  

  Like the other forms of paradox backlash, a weird is a change to a mage's pattern and cannot be healed or concealed. 

  The larger the weird complication the more serious, obvious, and limiting it is. Weirds larger then d12 can not simply be reduced by activating opportunities, the mage will require some kind of narrative justification to began the recovery process.

  There is no limit to the size of a weird. It can exceed d12 without turning you into an NPC, but weirds that large are very limiting.

  Trait   | Example Weirds
  :------:|:---------------
  d4      |  
  d6      |
  d8      |
  d10     |
  d12     |
  d12,d4  |
  d12,d6  |

  Weirds Table

#### Quiet

  Sometimes a paradox backlash attacks the mage with hallucinations, personality changes, madness, and vegetative states which serve to disconnect them from their community, their mind, and reality itself. 

  Quiet is much feared by mages because it pulls apart already tenuous groups and leaves individuals vulnerable and alone. Severe Quiets leave the mage in a total vegetative state, stripped of magickal power, and only able to interact with a strange nightmare world.

  Turn your paradox complication into a Quiet complication that will last until you can activate enough opportunities to remove it. 

  If you choose this twice, instead take a permanent d6 quiet, or step up an existing one. 

  Deep Quiets, larger then d12, place the mage's body in a vegetative state, and trap their mind in an endless hallucination unable to access their magickal ability. Escaping from deep quiet requires more then simply activating some opportunities. This could be a solo quest for the mage, similar to a Seeking for increased Arete. Or simply narrated as a montage. 

   Trait   | Example Quiets
  :------:|:---------------
  d4      |  
  d6      |
  d8      |
  d10     |
  d12     |

## Countermagick and other Defenses

  > some notes to make here. Need to clean up the correspondence and prime vs. just strait up duration traits. So that it's clear how to make an effect. 
  > also, need to workout what happens when you target someone. 
  > I think this right now: if you target a sleeper, they can't resist with magic. They can maybe resist with mundane traits, based on your effect, but that's it. As a mage you have to beat both reality and their resistance? or maybe not. Maybe you can just blurg sleepers all you want? 
  > if you target someone with magick though, they can add their arete and avatar rating, which now becomes a trait, to reality's dice pool. or maybe just avatar? eithe rway, they are harder to effect, and if they detect your working they can work their own countermagick which allows them to roll a full magickal counter?
  > then what? the main issue here is do we add to reality's dice pool, or do we all for a second resistance roll that you must also beat? Either one is possible, but which is easier?
  > if its a second roll, like, someone could still roll to dodge the physical manifestation of your spell? I don't like that. but if we just add to reality's pool...the main thing to ask is how avatar and arete actually work. logically, not mechanically. the more you know about how magick works in the SETTING the easier these kinds of questions are to answer. Therefore, as a mage you can resist a working directed at you with your avatar. And various sanctums traits and such for your location. If you are aware of the working and resist it, you can add your arete. If you practice some countermagick based on your correct

  > thats two rolls for the same thing. and, if your working includes, say, shoot for shooting, then there's no need to make a second attack roll, but...and this is a but, it may be that they can dodge your physical attack if they can see it coming. Which does kinda mean that they get a chance to make a roll to beat your total. just like reality does. eh, there are worse things.

## Rituals

  \[draft\] If two mages have compatible paradigms they can cooperate on a working with a greater chance of success.

  For ritual workings, I think you can pool your sphere dice together. And perhaps Arete? Probably. You can pool your Raw magick dice and get greater chance of success, but of course, if there's paradox involved, it will apply to every mage in the working.

## Summary

  Describe the narrative effect you want and decide the Effect dice, Duration, Range, and Scope, then roll your Magick dice pool.

  - Magick Dice Pool. Arete, the Spheres needed for the effect, and a Casting Time die for how long you take to work the effect.

  - Your two highest dice are you total. (Your Effect die comes from your initial choice, not from your dice pool)

  - Opportunities you roll can be activated to add/step up your Paradox; or to trigger a backlash complication.

  Then Reality rolls a reaction against your working using: your Effect dice the level of the Spheres required for the effect, and the Duration, Range and Scope you decided upon.

  - If there are Sleeper witnesses Reality can add a die from d6 to d12 depending on how many there are and how rigid their sense of reality is.

  - If your working is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total.

  - If your working is Coincidental Reality only gets 2 for it's total and Sleepers can be used as an Asset.

  - Opportunities can be activated to trigger a Paradox backlash of your own choice.

  If your total meets or beats reality's your effect is successful and you can apply your Effect dice to your targets.

  If you fail, your effect dice get added to your Paradox or trigger a backlash that may draw in more of your existing Paradox.
