# Working Magick

  Magick is a change in reality. One you make happen through an effort of your Enlightened Will. This change is called a *feat.* 
  
  It is possible to accomplish anything you desire through Magick, but the larger and more complex a feat you attempt, the more dice Reality will have to resist you and there are consequences for failing a mystick action. 
  
## Magick is an Expression of Your Will
 
  Because magick is an expression of your will, it requires a conscious choice by the Mage. 

## Leverage the Power of your Practice

  If you can describe your feat and how you with accomplish it within the context of your magickal *practice* you may add dice from your mundane traits, and not just your magickal ones. 
  
  > For example, if your practice is witchcraft you might describe collecting some physical token of your victim and creating a poppet with it which you poke with needles. Describing your effect in terms of your practice in this way will allow you to add your Mental and Occult traits.

## Raw Magick

  Mages occasionally perform feats with pure will and nothing else. Such Raw Magick transcends your focus and allows you to affect change without needing to follow the patterns and strictures of your practice. It is quicker and simpler, but more dangerous and difficult because only the Mystickal traits, Arete and Spheres, can be used. 

## Feats and Workings
  
  A feat is magick you accomplish in a single action. 

  A working is a collection of feats unified into a single magickal accomplishment. It might be a lone mage's project done slowly season by season, or a single spell woven by an entire cabal. 
  
  A feat may take an entire scene to complete, or it might be instantaneous, it might even grant you multiple actions in a single round, but those will be mundane actions. You may only attempt one feat per round. 

### Feats have One or More Effects

  A simple feat may have just one effect, like dealing damage with a bolt of flame, but complex feats may have as many different effects as you wish. 
  
  > For example, you create a life feat to give yourself claws d8 and armor d8.  

  Each effect is represented by an *effect die* and you choose how many, and how large, the effect dice of your feat will be.

### Effect Dice

  Pick your Effect Dice, the larger they are the grander and more powerful the scope of your spell. You may choose effect dice of any size and number. 
  
  To affect more then one target assign each an Effect Die. 

  Successes | Effect Dice | Feat       | Examples
  :--------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:---------
  1         | d4          | Trivial    | 
  2         | d6          | Typical    | 
  3         | d8          | Difficult  | 
  4         | d10         | Impressive | 
  5         | d12         | Mighty     | 
  6         | d12,d4      | Outlandish |
  7         | d12,d6      |            |
  10        | 2d12        | Godlike    |
  20        | 4d12        |            |

  Table: Effect Die rating

## Spheres

  Once your feat is clearly defined we'll determine how complex it is by determining its Sphere components. That is, what ratings of which Spheres your feat will require.

  > For example: You need to cross a gap between two building to escape some technocratic agents. You might calculate the coordinates of the rooftop you wish to be on and run a quick script on your wrist computer to alter your token's position in the virtual reality simulation that is reality; effectively teleporting across the distance. This would accomplish your feat using the sphere of Correspondence at d8. 

  > Alternately: You might speak a spell that calls upon mystick winds to levitate you across the gap. Making use of the Sphere of Forces at d8. 
  
  It is possible for your Effect to have multiple components of the same Sphere. This is especially common with Correspondence and Prime because those Spheres are used for common meta-magickal components. Such as targeting and extending the duration of your feats. 
  
  > For example, if you combine a d8 fire attack with a d8 levitation asset, you are controlling two distinct Forces which requires two d8 Forces components.
  
  Dice | Ability      | Description
  ----:|:------------:|:-----------
  d4   | Perception   | Observe and perceive elements of this Sphere beyond any mortal ken. 
  d6   | Manipulation | Make small changes to existing elements of this Sphere.
  d8   | Control      | Create noticeable effects with elements of this Sphere. This rank is generally for an effect to cause damage. 
  d10  | Command      | Create major effects. This rank is typically required to cause significant changes to the patterns of others.  
  d12  | Mastery      | Command vast effects with the elements of this Sphere.
  
  Table: Generic Sphere Ratings

### Meta-magick 

  Some sphere components extend the possibilities of your feat instead of directly relating to your effect and we refer to these as meta-magick. The two most common forms are using Correspondence to target your feat and Prime to extend the duration of it.

  Meta-magick components are not required, but they are always separate sphere components.

#### Targeting

  Without extra effort a feat is localized to you or your immediate environment, but by adding a Correspondence component to your feat it can reach a distant target or location. With the addition of Spirit your feat can reach into other worlds as well. 

  Targeting with Correspondence can be a matter of pure distance, but it can also mean reaching a target through something closely related to them. The use of a "lock of hair" is a classic example of relational Correspondence from the practice of Witchcraft. 

  Range targeting allows for vast distances but even if you have the ability to target anywhere on earth you must be able to identify a particular target. This can be done with line of sight unaided by mundane effects such as cameras or telescopes (mystick effects that match your focus may help), or by knowing in great detail where your target is at this exact moment. Without one of those things, you will need to use relational targeting instead. 

  With relational targeting you must possess something with a relation to your target which you'll use to channel your feat at your target. 

  Dice    | Range (Correspondence)         | Relation (Correspondence) 
  -------:|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------
  None    | Touch to immediate vicinity    | Yourself. 
  d4      | Within a neighborhood          | A fresh body sample of your target.
  d6      | Within a large city            | A boon companion. A meaningful possession of your target. 
  d8      | Within a state                 | A casual friend. A possession of your target. 
  d10     | Within a large country         | A casual acquaintance. A object your target once touched.  
  d12     | Within a continent             | A distant relation
  d12, d4 | Within a hemisphere            | 
  d12, d6 | Anywhere on earth              | No object, only a concept that relates to your target.

  Table: Targeting Magick by Distance or Relation with Correspondence

  Dice    | Extra-dimensionality (Spirit) 
  -------:|:---------------------------
  None    | Only the Mage's current locality and beings manifest upon it.
  d4      | Non-manifest spirits who've crossed into the current locality.
  d6      |  
  d8      | 
  d10     | 
  d12     | 
  d12, d4 |
  d12, d6 | 

  Table: Targeting Spirits and other Dimensions with Spirit

#### Duration

  Reality will relentlessly erode active magick unless you constantly support it with Quintessence.

  Without support a feat lasts a short while, typically no more then the length of your action, but if you spend a point of Quintessence the feat will endure for the length of a scene.

  Alternately, you may use the Sphere of Prime to fuel your feat from universal energy of creation.

  Dice    | Duration (Prime)
  -------:|:-----------------
  None    | Only a moment
  d4      | A few moments
  d6      | An Hour
  d8      | Several Hours
  d10     | A Week
  d12     | A Season
  d12, d4 | A year and a day
  d12, d6 | Beyond a year
  d12, d12| Until dispelled or destroyed

  Table: Extending the duration of magick with Prime  

#### Other Meta-effects

  Use a pattern sphere like life to tether a feat to someone so it will follow them around.  
  
  Using Time to create a delayed effect feat. 

  Using Mind to give your feat judgement about who or what to affect.  

## (draft section) Casting Time

  Your practice will dictate how long it takes to perform most feats, but you can give reality more dice to resist you if you attempt to finishing faster. 

  Dice    | Time
  -------:|:----------
  None    | All the time you desire.
  d4      | A day. 
  d6      | An hour.
  d8      | The length of a scene. Minutes.
  d10     | Two full actions. tens of seconds.
  d12     | A single action. Seconds
  d12, d8 | No time. You can also take a full mundane action. [Or d12, d12? or something more then d8]

## Realities & Localities 

  There are no neutral spaces in the Ascension war and most places are closely aligned to the technocratic consensus.  
  
  Locality is a trait representing how strongly aligned a place is with it's ruling reality and consequently, how strongly reality will resist your workings within it.
  
### Sanctums and Demesnes

  To aid their workings mages sometimes find or build localities that are friendly to their focus. 

  - If your effect die does not exceed the locality die, the effect can be considered coincidental.
  - Reality gets no extra locality die.

  localities do not add dice to magickal actions, on

### Technocratic Localities

  Technocratic localities tend to express technology, modernity, and globalization. The more hypermodern and related to globalized western power structures the stronger the locality.

  Dice  | Locality (Technocratic)
  -----:|:-------------
  d4    | A mundane place friendly to your practice      
  d6    | Typical western/globalized area
  d8    | Sprawl, suburbs, most urban areas
  d10   | Urban core, skyscraper  
  d12   | Science lab, stock exchange floor, ultra modern/smart building
  
  Table: Technocratic Locality

### Wyld Localities

  The Wyld is an inhuman reality. It's the power and terror of a natural world that is actively hostile to humanity. Wyld is a reality commonly associated with the Garou.

  Dice  | Locality (Wyld)
  -----:|:-------------
  d4    | A mundane place friendly to your practice
  d6    | Urban park
  d8    | A campground
  d10   | Deep wilderness
  d12   | Untouched wilderness
  
  Table: Wyld Locality

## Paradox
  
  Paradox is an expression of reality rejecting a mage and their magick. It accumulates as a pool of dice reality may use to resist feats or weave its way into spells. 

  Paradox is generated when a mage rolls a  

### Generating Paradox
#### When a Mage Rolls Opportunities

  When a mage rolls an opportunity on a magickal action it generates paradox. The GM will give the Mage one PP to activate all the opportunities rolled. Each opportunity can be used in one of several ways, but all are immediate and can even give reality extra dice to resist this feat.

  - Add a d6 to the Mage's Paradox 
    - Step up the die for each extra opportunity used
  - Step up one of the Mage's lowest Paradox dice
  - Work a d6 flaw into the Mage's feat
    - Step up that flaw for each extra opportunity used

#### When a Mage's Feat is Resisted

  If a mage's feat is successfully resisted by reality, this also generates paradox. The effect dice of the feat are added to the mage's paradox dice. Reality may then choose trigger a backlash. 

#### When a Mage Attempts a Vulgar Feat

  ? if a mage attempts a vulgar feat, this might also generate paradox automatically, depends on how it works for balance ?

### Using Paradox
#### Resisting Feats

  Reality can add any number of dice from a Mage's Paradox to it's pool for resisting a feat. Any paradox greater then the feat's effect dice will be lost unless the GM gives the Mage 1 PP per extra die to retain them. 

#### Flaws

  When a mage rolls opportunities on a feat, reality may choose to sneak a flaw into their feat instead of saving the paradox for later. 

  Flaws can complicate the mage's feat, but can't contradict it. For example, a flaw in a wall of fire feat can't change or reduce the effect dice of the fire, but it could cause blowback to damage the mage, or complicate the situation by setting something important on fire. 

  Flaws are more meaningful when the mage is attempting a long lasting working, like creating a wonder. Such complications last as long as the working does, which is one reason a Sanctum is so important for mage's planning on performing extended workings.

#### Backlash

  Backlash is a direct attempt by reality to protect itself by isolating the mage. 
    
  Besides the paradox generated when reality successfully resists a mage's feat a backlash might also be triggered. A backlash is something like an immune response to a mage, and it might inflict the mage with a persistent supernatural quirk or plunge them into a serious Quiet. 

  When a backlash is triggered the GM will burn and roll all of the mage's accumulated paradox dice plus any technocratic locality trait. The two highest rolling dice will be the total, and the largest remaining die will the size of the backlash. If there are no dice left, the backlash will start at d6.

  Then the Mage rolls to resist the backlash. The applicable traits are Mind, Arete, Prime, Paradox Prime specialty, Sanctum (if you are luck enough to be in one friendly to your focus), and Familiar. Some Distinctions and Wonders may also be of use if they specialized around paradox. 

  If the mage resists, they will be left with only a temporary paradox complication the size of the backlash. If they fail, the result will be a much longer lasting paradox flaw. 

  The backlash is stepped up for every 5 reality wins by, and if the backlash becomes larger then d12 the mage will be thrown into quiet instead of receiving a paradox flaw. 

##### Paradox Complications 

  These range from the inconvenient, such as instantly withering plants, to very intense, like being unable to answer a question with anything but excessive honesty, or continuously vomiting slime. 

  Paradox complications can be cruel, ironic or just eerie. It sometimes seem to relate to the mage involved but not always.  

  {List of interesting Paradox Complications Here}

###### Recovering from Paradox Complications

  Mages lucky enough to resist a backlash will get a temporary paradox complication which lasts for the rest of a particular story. 
  
  If the mage fails to resist, their complication is permanent until they have bought it off with Character Dice and some sufficient magickal work. 

  Buying off such a complication takes the same number of dice that it would to buy. And the complication can be bought down by spending a few character dice at a time.

##### Quiet

  Quiet is a vegetative sort of state where a mage is very much removed from the consensus reality and trapped in a bizarre world inside their head. 
  
  Quiet might turn into a solo quest for a mage to find a way out, or it might be a chance for the player to retire that character and start a new one. Quiet can be the end of a character's protagonism, or the beginning of a story. 

###### Recovering from Quiet

  ?How does one recover from quiet? what does that mean? is it maybe a case where you play a different character for a while?

### Burning Paradox

  when reality rolls opportunities, a mage has the chance to burn off their highest paradox die by paying a PP to burn off their highest paradox die as a weird complication that will generally last for the rest of the session. 

  If reality rolls more then one opportunity the Mage must step up their complication once for each additional opportunity. 

  [it's not uncommon for a 1 to get rolled, so mages should have a good chance to burn off paradox, but it like the slight negative disincentive for stepping up the complication for each opportunity rolled]  

  You can burn your highest die even if it's currently in a reality dice pool. This doesn't affect reality's total or anything. The complication will come after the feat is resolved.


## Magickal Actions

  - Clearly define your feat. What you will do and how you will do it
    - Pick your effect dice
    - Break your feat into sphere components
    - Assemble your dice pool, roll and determine your total
      - Opportunities you roll will grant PP and generate paradox for you, or flaws in your magick
  - Reality assembles it's dice pool and rolls to resist your efforts
    - 

### Focused Magick Dice Pool

  If your feat clearly flows from your mystick practice it is focused magick. Focused magick requires instruments, but allows you to use more dice.

  - Attribute
    - Include one Attribute based upon the instruments you are using
    - If you can justify it based on your instruments you may include another attributes by spending a PP  
  - Skill
    - Include one Skill based upon the instruments you are using 
      - Occult is commonly used for Mystick practices 
    - If you can justify it based on your instruments you may include another Skill by spending a PP  
    - You may include one appropriate Specialty from any Skill already in your pool
    - If you can justify it based on your instruments you may include another Specialty by spending a PP
  - Distinction
    - Traditions especially can help or hinder
    - Scene distinctions can also help or hinder
    - Resonance is a mystick distinction that a scene, location, tass might possess which can help or hinder particular kinds of magick
  - Arete
    - Include your Arete
    - You may add your Arete again if you spend a point of Quintessence
      - You may do this as many times as your Avatar rating
  - Spheres
    - Include each Sphere that is a part of your feat, only once
    - Additional Spheres cannot be added with PP or Quintessence
  - Assets
    - You may be able to include one Asset 
    - Mundane assets might help you in focusing your will to perform magick
    - Mystick assets, especially resonance, might help you in your feat
    - When using mundane assets as instruments you may be able to include them if they are extraordinary
      - for example, by being of great historical significance or possessing resonance
  - Complications
    - The scene, or your target, may have a complication helpful to your feat

### Raw Magick Dice Pool

  Raw magick is an instantaneous working of pure will that transcends all of your beliefs about reality. It is often a desperate Mage's last resort because it is difficult and dangerous. 
  
  You can use only your Mystickal traits when working Raw Magick which means fewer dice and a greater chance of failure. On the other hand, the *Effect* of Raw Magick is not bound by your practice and requires no instruments or preparation.  

  - Arete
    - Include your Arete
    - You may add your Arete again if you spend a point of Quintessence
      - You may do this as many times as your Avatar rating
  - Spheres
    - Include each Sphere that is a part of your feat, only once
    - Additional Spheres cannot be added with PP or Quintessence
  - Assets
    - You may be able to include one Asset 
    - Mystick assets, especially resonance, might help you in your feat

# (do we need a section about opportunities here? paradox burning paradox? it is a part of action, but it's also a thing unto itself. like spheres)

### Reality Resists Your Magick

  Once you've rolled for your feat, Reality will oppose you with a dice pool based on your effect dice and the Sphere components of your feat.
  
  - Locality
    - Includes a place's locality trait
  - Effect Dice
    - Includes the effect dice from your feat
  - Sphere components
    - Includes the Sphere components of your feat
    - May include the same Sphere multiple times
  - Paradox
    - Reality can spend dice from your paradox and add them to it's pool to resist your feat
    - This may even be paradox generated by opportunities you created when rolling for your feat
    - Optionally, reality may pay you a PP per die to keep the paradox it used, otherwise they are permanently spent

  If your feat is Coincidental Reality gets 2 dice for it's total.

  If your feat is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total [and you will get an extra d6 Paradox regardless of whether your feat succeeds or fails.]

### Outcomes

  If reality fails to beat your total by at least 1 your feat is a success. Otherwise, your effect dice gets added to your paradox pool, and perhaps greater retribution if paradox burns off.

## Resisting workings, targeting sleepers or other awakened

  > some notes to make here. Need to clean up the correspondence and prime vs. just strait up duration traits. So that it's clear how to make an effect. 
  > also, need to workout what happens when you target someone. 
  > I think this right now: if you target a sleeper, they can't resist with magic. They can maybe resist with mundane traits, based on your effect, but that's it. As a mage you have to beat both reality and their resistance? or maybe not. Maybe you can just blurg sleepers all you want? 
  > if you target someone with magick though, they can add their arete and avatar rating, which now becomes a trait, to reality's dice pool. or maybe just avatar? eithe rway, they are harder to effect, and if they detect your working they can work their own countermagick which allows them to roll a full magickal counter?
  > then what? the main issue here is do we add to reality's dice pool, or do we all for a second resistance roll that you must also beat? Either one is possible, but which is easier?
  > if its a second roll, like, someone could still roll to dodge the physical manifestation of your spell? I don't like that. but if we just add to reality's pool...the main thing to ask is how avatar and arete actually work. logically, not mechanically. the more you know about how magick works in the SETTING the easier these kinds of questions are to answer. Therefore, as a mage you can resist a working directed at you with your avatar. And various sanctums traits and such for your location. If you are aware of the working and resist it, you can add your arete. If you practice some countermagick based on your correct
  > Counter-magick is page 546 in the m20 book
  > from their perspective, if you successfully create a fireball you still have to hit someone with it. 
  > which I am dubious about. 
  > thats two rolls for the same thing. and, if your working includes, say, shoot for shooting, then there's no need to make a second attack roll, but...and this is a but, it may be that they can dodge your physical attack if they can see it coming. Which does kinda mean that they get a chance to make a roll to beat your total. just like reality does. eh, there are worse things. 
  > be free with information to the players. There's no need to hide things. With Cortex plus it will all even out. 
  > which says to me, that you can dodge physical effects maybe, you can also resist magic if you have an avatar and some arete.  Avatar is always added. 
  > I wonder if you could thus, mundanely resist mind control? that's what willpower was suppose to be for. 
  > 

## Ritual Workings

  \[draft\] If two mages have compatible paradigms they can cooperate on a working with a greater chance of success.

  For ritual workings, I think you can pool your sphere dice together. And perhaps Arete? Probably. You can pool your Raw magick dice and get greater chance of success, but of course, if there's paradox involved, it will apply to every mage in the working.

## Summary

  Describe the narrative effect you want and decide the Effect dice, Duration, Range, and Scope, then roll your Magick dice pool.

  - Magick Dice Pool. Arete, the Spheres needed for the effect, and a Casting Time die for how long you take to work the effect.

  - Your two highest dice are you total. (Your Effect die comes from your initial choice, not from your dice pool)

  - Opportunities you roll can be activated to add/step up your Paradox; or to trigger a backlash complication.

  Then Reality rolls a reaction against your working using: your Effect dice the level of the Spheres required for the effect, and the Duration, Range and Scope you decided upon.

  - If there are Sleeper witnesses Reality can add a die from d6 to d12 depending on how many there are and how rigid their sense of reality is.

  - If your working is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total.

  - If your working is Coincidental Reality only gets 2 for it's total and Sleepers can be used as an Asset.

  - Opportunities can be activated to trigger a Paradox backlash of your own choice.

  If your total meets or beats reality's your effect is successful and you can apply your Effect dice to your targets.

  If you fail, your effect dice get added to your Paradox or trigger a backlash that may draw in more of your existing Paradox.
