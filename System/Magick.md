# Working Magick

  Magick is a change, any change, in reality you make through an effort of your Enlightened Will. This change is called a *feat.* 
  
  It is possible to accomplish anything through Magick, but the larger and more complex your feat, the more dice Reality will have to resist you, and their are consequences to failing.
  
  Because magick is an expression of your will, it requires a conscious choice by the Mage. 

  If you can describe your feat and how you with accomplish it within the context of your magickal *practice* you may add dice from your mundane traits, and not just your magickal ones. 
  
  > For example, if your practice is witchcraft you might describe collecting some physical token of your victim and creating a poppet with it which you poke with needles. Describing your effect in terms of your practice in this way will allow you to add your Mental and Occult traits.

  Mages occasionally perform feats with pure will and nothing else. Such Raw Magick transcends your focus and allows you to affect change without needing to follow the patterns and strictures of your practice. It is quicker and simpler, but more dangerous and difficult becuase only the Mystickal traits, Arete and Spheres, can be used. 

## Feats and Workings
  
  A feat is magick you accomplish in a single action. 

  A working is a collection of feats unified into a single magickal accomplishment. It might be a lone mage's project done slowly feat by feat, or a single spell woven by an entire cabal. 
  
  A feat may take an entire scene to complete, or it might be instantaneous, it might even grant you multiple actions in a single round, but those will be mundane actions. You may only attempt one feat per round. 

  A simple feat may have just one effect, like dealing damage with a bolt of flame, but complex feats may have as many different effects as you wish. For example, your bolt of fire might deal immediate damage but also complicate the life or your target by burning away their false skin to reveal the android beneith. 

  Each effect is represented by an *effect die* and you choose how many, and how large, the effect dice of your feat will be.

### Effect Dice

  Pick your Effect Dice. 
  
  These may be any number of dice of any size, you may choose an effect die larger then d12 by adding additional dice to that effect. The larger an Effect Die the grander the scope and power of your spell. 

  If you wish to affect more then one target assign each an Effect Die. 

  Successes | Effect Dice | Feat       | Examples
  :--------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:---------
  1         | d4          | Trivial    | 
  2         | d6          | Typical    | 
  3         | d8          | Difficult  | 
  4         | d10         | Impressive | 
  5         | d12         | Mighty     | 
  6         | d12,d4      | Outlandish |
  7         | d12,d6      |            |
  10        | 2d12        | Godlike    |
  20        | 4d12        |            |

  Table: Effect Die rating

## Spheres

  Once your feat is clearly defined we'll determine how difficult it is by determining its Sphere components. That is, which Spheres, and at which size, best represent the feat as you have described it.
 
  > For example: You need to cross a gap between two building to escape some technocratic agents. You might calculate the coordinates of the rooftop you wish to be on and run a quick script on your wrist computer to alter your token's position in the virtual reality simulation that is reality; effectively teleporting across the distance. This accomplishes your feat using Technology and the sphere of Correspondence.   

  > Alternately: You might speek a spell that calls upon the mystic winds of watoomb to levitate you across the gap. Making use of your Occult skill and the Sphere of Forces. 
  
  It is possible for your Effect to have multiple components of the same Sphere. This is especially common with Corrispondence and Prime because those Spheres are used for common meta-magickal components. Such as targeting and extending the duration of your feats. 
  
  > For example, if you combine a d8 fire attack with a d8 levitation asset, you are controlling two distinct Forces which requires two d8 Forces components.
  
  Dice | Ability      | Description
  ----:|:------------:|:-----------
  d4   | Perception   | Observe and perceive elements of this Sphere beyond any mortal ken. 
  d6   | Manipulation | Make small changes to existing elements of this Sphere.
  d8   | Control      | Create noticeable effects with elements of this Sphere. This rank is generally for an effect to cause damage. 
  d10  | Command      | Create major effects. This rank is typically required to cause significant changes to the patterns of others.  
  d12  | Mastery      | Command vast effects with the elements of this Sphere.
  
  Table: Generic Sphere Ratings

### Meta-magick 

  Some sphere components extend the possibilities of your feat instead of directly realating to your effect. These we refer to generally as Meta-magick. The two most common forms are using the Corrispondence sphere for targeting your feat and Prime for extending the duration of it.

  Meta-magick components are not required, but when used, they are separte instances of that sphere.

#### Targeting

  Without extra effort the effects of magick are localized to the mage and their most immediate environment. However, by adding a Correspondence component it is possible to make a feat reach a target or location at any distance. With the addition of Spirit the feat can reach into other worlds as well. 

  Targeting with Correspondence can be a matter of pure distance, but it can also take the form of reaching the target through something closely realted to them. The classic "spell upon a lock of their hair" is an example of relational Correspondence from the practice of Witchcraft. 

  Range targeting allows for vast distances but even if you have the ability to target anywhere on earth you must be able to indentify a particular target. This can be done with line of sight unaided by mundane effects such as cameras or telescopes (mystick effects that match your focus may help), or by knowing in great detail where your target is at this exact momement. Without one of those things, you will need to use realational targeting instead. 

  With realational targeting you must possess some object that has a concrete relation to your target. Providing you can touch and hold this object you may attempt to channel your feat through it and at your target. 

  Dice    | Range (Correspondence)         | Relation (Correspondence) 
  -------:|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------
  None    | Touch to immediate vicinity    | Yourself. 
  d4      | Within a neighborhood          | A fresh body sample of your target.
  d6      | Within a large city            | A boon companion. A meaningful posession of your target. 
  d8      | Within a state                 | A casual friend. A posession of your target. 
  d10     | Within a large country         | A casual aquantaince. A object your target touched.  
  d12     | Within a continent             | Distance. One trivial kind of relation. These are the same color object. We are both human.
  d12, d6 | Anywhere on earth              | No object, only a concept that relates to your target.

  Table: Targeting Magick by Distance or Relation with Correspondence

  Dice    | Extra-dimensionality (Spirit) 
  -------:|:---------------------------
  None    | Only the Mage's current locality and beings manifest upon it.
  d4      | Non-manifest spirits who've crossed into the current locality.
  d6      | 
  d8      | 
  d10     | 
  d12     | 
  d12, d6 | 

  Table: Targeting Spirits and other Dimensions with Spirit

#### Duration

  Magick may have long lasting consequences, but reality will relentlessly errode active magick unless you constantly support it with Quintessence.

  Without support a feat lasts a short while, typically no more then the length of your action, but if you spend a point of Quintessnce the feat will endure for the length of a scene. 
  
  Alternately, you may use the Sphere of Prime to fuel your magick from universal energy of creation and make it last longer then a moment.

  Dice    | Duration (Prime)
  -------:|:-----------------
  None    | Only a moment
  d4      | A few moments
  d6      | An Hour
  d8      | A Week
  d10     | A Season
  d12     | A year and a day
  d12, d6 | Beyond a year
  d12, d12| May lasts unless dispelled

  Table: Extending the duration of magick with Prime  

#### Other Meta-effects

  Use a pattern sphere like life to tether a feat to someone so it will follow them around.  
  
  Using Time to create a delayed effect feat. 

  Using Mind to give your feat judgement about who or what to affect.  

## (draft section) Casting Time

  Your practice will dictate how long it takes to perform most feats, but you can give reality more dice to resist you if you attempt to finishing faster. 

  Dice    | Time
  -------:|:----------
  None    | All the time you desire.
  d4      | A day. 
  d6      | An hour.
  d8      | The length of a scene. Minutes.
  d10     | Two full actions. tens of seconds.
  d12     | A single action. Seconds
  d12, d8 | No time. You can also take a full mundane action. [Or d12, d12? or something more then d8]

## Realities & Localities 

  There are no neutral spaces in the Ascension war. Everywhere you might be is aligned to one reality or another, most commonly the technocratic consensus, and few of them are welcoming to a mage's enlightened will.  
  
  Locality is a trait representing how strongly aligned your current location is with it's reality. 
  
  Reality adds the locality trait to its dice pool for resistance, so the stronger the locality, the more it will resist your magick. 

### Technocratic Localites

  Technocratic localities tend to express technology, modernity, and globalization. The more hypermodern and related to globalized western power structures the stronger the locality.

  Dice  | Locality (Technocratic)
  -----:|:-------------
  d4    | Wilderness, Ancient human places, A mundane place friendly to your practice      
  d6    | Typical western/globalized area
  d8    | Sprawl, suburbs, most urban areas
  d10   | Urban core, skycraper  
  d12   | Science Lab, stock exchange floor, ultra modern building
  
  Table: Technocratic Locality 

### Wyld Localities

  Wyld is a distinctly inhuman power. It's the power and terror of a natural world that makes no distiction between humans and bugs. Wyld is a reality commonly associated with the Garou. 

  Dice  | Locality (Wyld)
  -----:|:-------------
  d4    | 
  d6    | 
  d8    | 
  d10   | 
  d12   |

## Paradox
   
  [getting it, burning, triggering backlashes. detecting it.]

  Paradox is an energy of reality's rejection of a mage and their magick. It can accumulate around the mage as a pool of dice, or weave its way into their spell as flaws and consequences. 

  Reality can use these dice to help resist a mage's feat. If a mage fails in a magickal action, they will generate significant paradox and reality might trigger a backlash against the mage.  

  Each mage has their own Paradox dice pool. These dice are generally a secret from the players, but with a fair Prime effect it's possible to learn the size of a mage's largest Paradox dice. 

### Generating Paradox

#### When a Mage Rolls Opportunities

  When a mage rolls an an opportunity on a magickal action it generates paradox. The GM will give the Mage one PP to activate all the opportunities rolled. Each opportunity can be used in one of several ways, but all are immediate and can even give reality extra dice to resist this feat.

  - Add a d6 to the Mage's Paradox 
    - Step up the die for each extra opportunity used
  - Step up one of the Mage's lowest Paradox dice
  - Work a d6 flaw into the Mage's feat
    - Step up that flaw for each extra opportunity used

#### When a Mage's Feat is Resisted

  If a mage's feat is successfully resisted by reality, this also generates paradox. The effect dice of the feat are added to the mage's paradox dice. Reality may then choose trigger a backlash. 

#### When a Mage Attempts a Vulgar Feat

  ? if a mage attempts a vulgar feat, this might also generate paradox automatically, depends on how it works for balance ?

### Using Paradox

#### Resisting Feats

  Reality can add any number of dice from a Mage's Paradox to it's pool for resisting a feat. Any paradox greater then the feat's effect dice will be lost unless the GM gives the Mage 1 PP per extra die to retain them. 

#### Flaws

  When a mage rolls opportunties on a feat, reality may choose to sneak a flaw into their feat instead of saving the paradox for later. 

  Flaws can complicate the mage's feat, but can't contradict it. For example, a flaw in a wall of fire feat can't change or reduce the effect dice of the fire, but it could cause blowback to damage the mage, or complicate the situation by setting something important on fire. 

#### Backlash

  Besides, the paradox generated when reality successfully resists a mage's feat, a backlash might also be triggered. A backlash is something like an immune response to a mage, and it might inflict the mage with a persistant supernatural quirk or plunge them into a serious Quiet. 

  When a backlash is triggered the GM will roll all of the mage's accumulated paradox dice the two highest rolling dice will be the total, and the largest remaining die will the size of the backlash. If there are no dice left, the backlash will start at d6.

  Then the Mage rolls to resist the backlash. The applicable traits are Mind, Arete, Prime, Paradox Prime specialty, Sanctum, and Familiar. Some Distinctions and Wonders may also be of use, but only ones specialized around paradox.

  ? So, your backlash die becomes a complication and gets stepped up for every 5 reality beats your total by. If your backlash is larger then d12 add a d6 and keep stepping up that die if needed. Backlash greater then d12 will result in quiet. ?

### Burning Paradox

  when reality rolls opportunities, a mage has the chance to burn off their highest paradox die by paying a PP to burn off their highest paradox die as a weird complication that will generally last for the rest of the session. 

  If reality rolls more then one opportunity the Mage must step up their complication once for each additional opportunity. 

  [it's not uncommon for a 1 to get rolled, so mages should have a good chance to burn off paradox, but it like the slight negative disinsentive for stepping up the complication for each opportunity rolled]  

  You can burn your highest die even if it's currently in a reality dice pool. This doesn't affect reality's total or anything. The complication will come after the feat is resolved.

#### Paradox Complications

  These range from the inconvenient, such as instantly withering plants, to very intense such as being unable to answer a question with anything but full and complete honesty. Or continuously vomiting slime. 

  Paradox complications can be cruel, typical, ironic or just eerie. It sometimes seem to realate to the mage involved, but not always.  

### Backlash

  If a mage fails a feat, add the feat's effect dice to the mage's paradox and then reality may trigger a backlash which consumes all of a mage's paradox at once. 

  Backlash is a direct attempt by reality to protect itself by isolating the mage. 

  Reality rolls all of the Mage's paradox dice and it's current locality trait, (some assets or scene distictions may also apply) and determines two dice for a total ?and an effect die? 

  The Mage rolls their Mind, Arete, and Prime to resist. Some other traits can help, especially the familiar background.

## Magickal Actions

  - Clearly define your feat. What you will do and how you will do it
    - Pick your effect dice
    - Break your feat into sphere components
    - Assemble your dice pool, roll and determine your total
      - Opportunities you roll will grant PP and generate paradox for you, or flaws in your magick
  - Reality assembles it's dice pool and rolls to resist your efforts
    - 

### Focused Magick Dice Pool

  If your feat clearly flows from your msytick practice it is focused magick. Focused magick requires instruments, but allows you to use more dice.

  - Attribute
    - Include one Attribute based upon the instruments you are using
    - If you can justify it based on your intruments you may include another Atribute by spending a PP  
  - Skill
    - Include one Skill based upon the instruments you are using 
      - Occult is commonly used for Mystick practices 
    - If you can justify it based on your intruments you may include another Skill by spending a PP  
    - You may include one appropriate Specialty from any Skill already in your pool
    - If you can justify it based on your instruments you may include another Specialty by spending a PP
  - Distinction
    - Traditions especially can help or hinder
    - Scene distinctions can also help or hinder
    - Resonance is a mystick distinction that a scene, location, tass might possess which can help or hinder particular kinds of magick
  - Arete
    - Include your Arete
    - You may add your Arete again if you spend a point of Quintessence
      - You may do this as many times as your Avatar rating
  - Spheres
    - Include each Sphere that is a part of your feat, only once
    - Additional Spheres cannot be added with PP or Quintessence
  - Assets
    - You may be able to include one Asset 
    - Mundane assets might help you in focusing your will to perform magick
    - Mystick assets, especially resonance, might help you in your feat
    - When using mundane assets as instruments you may be able to include them if they are extraordinary
      - for example, by being of great historical significance or possessing reasonance
  - Complications
    - The scene, or your target, may have a complication helpful to your feat

### Raw Magick Dice Pool

  Raw magick is an instantaneous working of pure will that transcends all of your beliefs about reality. It is often a desperate Mage's last resort because it is difficult and dangerous. 
  
  You can use only your Mystickal traits when working Raw Magick which means fewer dice and a greater chance of failure. On the other hand, the *Effect* of Raw Magick is not bound by your practice and requires no instruments or preparation.  

  - Arete
    - Include your Arete
    - You may add your Arete again if you spend a point of Quintessence
      - You may do this as many times as your Avatar rating
  - Spheres
    - Include each Sphere that is a part of your feat, only once
    - Additional Spheres cannot be added with PP or Quintessence
  - Assets
    - You may be able to include one Asset 
    - Mystick assets, especially resonance, might help you in your feat

# (do we need a section about opportunties here? paradox burning paradox? it is a part of action, but it's also a thing unto itself. like wpheres)

### Reality Resists Your Magick

  Once you've rolled for your feat, Reality will oppose you with a dice pool based on your effect dice and the Sphere compoents of your feat.
  
  - Locality
    - Includes a place's locality trait
  - Effect Dice
    - Includes the effect dice from your feat
  - Sphere components
    - Includes the Sphere components of your feat
    - May include the same Sphere multiple times
  - Paradox
    - Reality can spend dice from your paradox and add them to it's pool to resist your feat
    - This may even be paradox generated by opportunties you created when rolling for your feat
    - Optionally, reality may pay you a PP per die to keep the paradox it used, otherwise they are permenantly spent

  If your feat is Coincidental Reality gets 2 dice for it's total.

  If your feat is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total and you will get an extra d6 Paradox regardless of whether your feat succeeds or fails.

### Outcomes

  If reality fails to beat your total by at least 1 your feat is a success. Otherwise, your effect dice gets added to your paradox pool, and perhaps greater retribution if paradox burns off.

## Resisting workings, targeting sleepers or other awakened

  > some notes to make here. Need to clean up the correspondence and prime vs. just strait up duration traits. So that it's clear how to make an effect. 
  > also, need to workout what happens when you target someone. 
  > I think this right now: if you target a sleeper, they can't resist with magic. They can maybe resist with mundane traits, based on your effect, but that's it. As a mage you have to beat both reality and their resistance? or maybe not. Maybe you can just blurgh sleepers all you want? 
  > if you target someone with magick though, they can add their arete and avatar rating, which now becomes a trait, to reality's dice pool. or maybe just avatar? eitherway, they are harder to effect, and if they detect your working they can work their own countermagick which allows them to roll a full magickal counter?
  > then what? the main issue here is do we add to reality's dice pool, or do we all for a second resistance roll that you must also beat? Either one is possible, but which is easier?
  > if its a second roll, like, someone could still roll to dodge the physical manifestation of your spell? I don't like that. but if we just add to reality's pool...the main thing to ask is how avatar and arete actualyl work. logically, not mechanically. the more you know about how magick works in the SETTING the easier these kinds of questions are to answer. Therefore, as a mage you can resist a working directed at you with your avatar. And various sanctums traits and such for your location. If you are aware of the working and resist it, you can add your arete. If you practice some countermagick based on your correct
  > Counter-magick is page 546 in the m20 book
  > from their perspective, if you successfully create a fireball you still have to hit someone with it. 
  > which I am dubious about. 
  > thats two rolls for the same thing. and, if your working includes, say, shoot for shooting, then there's no need to make a second attack roll, but...and this is a but, it may be that they can dodge your physical attack if they can see it coming. Which does kinda mean that they get a chance to make a roll to beat your total. just like reality does. eh, there are worse things. 
  > be free with information to the players. There's no need to hide things. With Cortex plus it will all even out. 
  > which says to me, that you can dodge physical effects maybe, you can also resist magic if you have an avatar and some arete.  Avatar is always added. 
  > I wonder if you could thus, mundanely resist mind control? that's what willpower was suppose to be for. 
  > 

## Ritual Workings

  \[draft\] If two mages have compatible paradigms they can cooperate on a working with a greater chance of success.

  For ritual workings, I think you can pool your sphere dice together. And perhaps Arete? Probably. You can pool your Raw magick dice and get greater chance of success, but of course, if there's paradox involved, it will apply to every mage in the working.

## Summary

  Describe the narrative effect you want and decide the Effect dice, Duration, Range, and Scope, then roll your Magick dice pool.

  - Magick Dice Pool. Arete, the Spheres needed for the effect, and a Casting Time die for how long you take to work the effect.

  - Your two highest dice are you total. (Your Effect die comes from your initial choice, not from your dice pool)

  - Opportunities you roll can be activated to add/step up your Paradox; or to trigger a backlash complication.

  Then Reality rolls a reaction against your working using: your Effect dice the level of the Spheres required for the effect, and the Duration, Range and Scope you decided upon.

  - If there are Sleeper witnesses Reality can add a die from d6 to d12 depending on how many there are and how rigid their sense of reality is.

  - If your working is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total.

  - If your working is Coincidental Reality only gets 2 for it's total and Sleepers can be used as an Asset.

  - Opportunities can be activated to trigger a Paradox backlash of your own choice.

  If your total meets or beats reality's your effect is successful and you can apply your Effect dice to your targets.

  If you fail, your effect dice get added to your Paradox or trigger a backlash that may draw in more of your existing Paradox.
