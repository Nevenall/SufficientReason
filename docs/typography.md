# The Typography of Sufficient Reason

This is for notes and details about the typography of this project. 

I've choosen a header font with brush details and given it an old fashioned vermillion ink like color. 
The primary text and toolbar color is an indigo ink color and the background is an inverse of the indigo ink color but turns out to be a pleasant parchment-like color. 

the idea is to provide a slightly medieval feeling. 

## Cortex Prime

has a number of distinct game elements. 

{Trait Name}  will render as small caps

Trait Group Names, render as small caps in bold? 

Special Effects associated with a trait. 
*sfx* Description.


special effects can also have names, which are italics. 
You know what, why don't we take a look a the cortex prime doc. 

Also, what if we did some text, like trait group names in the secondary red color?
