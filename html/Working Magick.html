<h1 id="focused-magick">Focused Magick</h1>
<p>Your focus describes a collection of beliefs about how reality works and tools through which you focus the power of those beliefs into magick.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When performing focused magick start by defining the Effect of your working and specifically how it flows from your focus. The clearer your statement of narrative intent is the easier the rest of the process will be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once you have a clear narrative intent for your overall Effect you can break it down into it's discrete component Spheres and determine the level required from each Sphere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is possible for your Effect to have multiple components of the same Sphere. For example if your magickal attack will have a d6 Fire effect and a d6 electricity effect, you have two different Forces 3 components.</p>
<p>In this case you'd add your Forces trait only once, but reality will get 2d8 for the two Forces 3 components.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Range of your Effect will be a Correspondence component.</p>
<p>The Duration of your Effect will be Prime component.</p>

<h1 id="raw-magick">Raw Magick</h1>
<p>It's possible to perform workings that are not focused through your paradigm and instead rely upon your raw will and experience with reality. These can be very difficult to achieve and thus quite dangerous.</p>

<h1 id="casting-time">Casting Time</h1>
<p>How long you take to achieve your working.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>D4 – No time. You can also take a mundane action before or after this</p>
<p>D6 – Takes the length of your action. Pass the initiative</p>
<p>D8 – Takes this action and your next one</p>
<p>D10 – Takes the length of this scene</p>
<p>D12 – Takes longer than this scene</p>
<p> </p>
<h1 id="reality-resists-your-working">Reality Resists Your Working</h1>
<p>Once you've rolled to create your effect, Reality will oppose you with a dice pool that's composed based on the effect you are attempting to create.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reality Dice Pool</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Size of your Effect (d6 or larger)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This can be a single Effect larger than d12</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a d12,d6 Effect could take out someone in a single action but Reality will get a d12 and a d6 to resist</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It can also be multiple Effects</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if needed, you can declare several different Effects</p>
<ul>
<li>Reality gets to add all of them</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Level of Sphere effects you are attempting</p>
<ul>
<li><p>From d4 to d12.</p></li>
<li><p>A Life 3 Effect would be a d8. A Prime 5, Mind 5 Effect would be 2d12.</p></li>
<li><p>Duration is a Prime effect</p></li>
<li><p>Range is a Correspondence effect</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The scope of the effect</p>
<ul>
<li>From d4 to d12 or more</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Paradox</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reality can spend dice from a mage's paradox to add to it's pool to resist a working</p></li>
<li><p>And can optionally pay the affected mage a PP per die to keep them</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h1>
<p>For Coincidental workings Reality gets 2 dice for it's total.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For Vulgar workings Reality gets 3 dice for it's total and you'll get an extra d6 Paradox regardless of whether your working succeeds or fails.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you meet or beat reality's total your working is a success. Otherwise, your effect dice gets added to your paradox pool, and perhaps greater retribution if paradox burns off.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1 id="duration">Duration</h1>
<p>How long will your effect last?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>D4 – No Time. Lasts only long enough for a reaction.</p>
<p>D6 – Lasts until your next action.</p>
<p>D8 – Lasts for a Scene.</p>
<p>D10 – Lasts until the next dusk/dawn.</p>
<p>D12 – Lasts for a Season.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1 id="range">Range</h1>
<p>The distance your effect will reach across. [this is a targeting kind of thing]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>D4 – Only yourself.</p>
<p>D6 – Takes your action. Pass the initiative.</p>
<p>D8 – Takes this action and your next one.</p>
<p>D10 – Takes the scene.</p>
<p>D12 – Takes longer than the scene.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1 id="scope">Scope</h1>
<p>How large and widespread is your effect?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>D4 – Only yourself</p>
<p>D6 – One person</p>
<p>D8 – A crowd</p>
<p>D10 – A Building</p>
<p>D12 – Takes longer than the scene.</p>

<h1 id="ritual-workings">Ritual Workings</h1>
<p>[draft] If two mages have compatible paradigms they can cooperate on a working with a greater chance of success.</p>
<p>For ritual workings, I think you can pool your sphere dice together. And perhaps Arete? Probably. You can pool your Raw magick dice and get greater chance of success, but of course, if there's paradox involved, it will apply to every mage in the working.</p>
<h1 id="section-2"> </h1>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Describe the narrative effect you want and decide the Effect dice, Duration, Range, and Scope, then roll your Magick dice pool.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Magick Dice Pool. Arete, the Spheres needed for the effect, and a Casting Time die for how long you take to work the effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Your two highest dice are you total. (Your Effect die comes from your initial choice, not from your dice pool)</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunities you roll can be activated to add/step up your Paradox; or to trigger a backlash complication.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Then Reality rolls a reaction against your working using: your Effect dice, the level of the Spheres required for the effect, and the Duration, Range, and Scope you decided upon.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there are Sleeper witnesses Reality can add a die from d6 to d12 depending on how many there are and how rigid their sense of reality is.</p></li>
<li><p>If your working is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total.</p></li>
<li><p>If your working is Coincidental Reality only gets 2 for it's total and Sleepers can be used as an Asset.</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunities can be activated to trigger a Paradox backlash of your own choice.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If your total meets or beats reality's your effect is successful and you can apply your Effect dice to your targets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you fail, your effect dice get added to your Paradox or trigger a backlash that may draw in more of your existing Paradox.</p>
