<p>It is a clear night but the city is still wet from the passing of a sudden rain. There's a specialness to the way the amber street lights reflect off the pooling water, as if this was a perfectly filtered and filmed scene in a movie.
There is a quietness to traffic that is unusual. So much so, Joseph Nix can the hear the bubbles in the pool at his feet. Rising up from deep within a plugged up storm drain.
Joseph is on his way to a strangely late night class at his dojo the head instructor, Mifune, invited him to. This flooded storm drain is the last obstacle in his way.</p>
<p>Inside the dojo is already a bustle with people sparring, stretching, meditating. Joseph looks around but he recognizes none of the people here. For a moment perhaps he wonders if he misunderstood Mifune's invitation, but then he sees the head instructor showing a petite latina a stance Joseph has never seen before.</p>
<p>What does Joseph do next?</p>
