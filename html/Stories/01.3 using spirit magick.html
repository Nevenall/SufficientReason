<p>Lol. Not with a shout but with a shanking.
These are untested magick rules so revisions and updates may be needed. Comments are welcome.</p>
<p>Lets use Raw Spirit magick to see/sense the spirit side of someone</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick the size of your Effect die (d6 to d12) the larger the more information you can gather but also gives reality a large die to resist you. d6 is good enough to know human from not human.</li>
<li>Sensing Spirit is a simple rank 1 (d6) effect. So far reality has 2d6 to resist your working.</li>
<li>dude is close to you and clearly visible, so you won't need any Correspondence effect to target him.</li>
<li>This will give you a quick flash of vision. If you want your special vision to last longer you can include a Prime effect.</li>
<li>Decide how long you will spend casting. Instantly is d4.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, assuming an instant flash of basic insight works for you you'll roll Salazar's Arete (d10) + Spirit (d10) + Casting Time (d4) first. Set aside any 1s, and pick upto 2 of the remaining dice to be your Total. 1s you roll will give you plot points but generate paradox dice, which I will secretely track.
Then Reality will roll Effect die (d6) + Spirit 1 Effect (d6) and try to get a higher Total then you.</p>
