<p>Salazar feels the rusty sliver of paradox from his magickal feat slide under his thumbnail as he watches cargo shorts bro hug a couple more dudes but then their forms start to wobble and bleed colors as the they move.</p>
<p>The Bag Lady begains some kind of crazy prayer and John feels a strange elation that smells like lilacs while the words of the prayer march towards like wave after wave of domino soliders.</p>
<p>As the finally ghostly echoes of word soldiers fade away you can both hear the voice of the Bag Lady, now magnified into a roar. &quot;Ignore all that sweeties. That's the just the acid.&quot; And then she blows a puff of some kind of ash into the wind that carries away the rest of the reality you were standing in.</p>
<p>how to approach this? maybe from the outside?
do they find themselves together or not as they start?</p>
<p>could be an individual discussion Could be salazar gets a little lost.</p>
<p>movie style establishing shot?</p>
<p>I think it would be better to ease into it from salazar's point of view. he's about to get a drop of spirit magick.</p>
<p>Bag Lady is working magick</p>
<p>she's going to give all three of them the ability to see avatars. Seeing avatars is Mind 3/Prime 2/Spirit 1
adding the sharing of that as Life 2.</p>
<p>That's a complex effect.</p>
<p>Alba has:
Mental d10
Tradition d8
Occult d10
Arete d12
Mind d8
Prime d6
Spirit d10</p>
<p>[going to remove the casting time because that's more or less dependent on the practice. and it's extra dice we don't need to use. ]</p>
<p>Reality gets:
Effect d8
Mind d8
Prime d6
Spirit d4
Duration Prime d8, long enough to have a conversation</p>
<p>Plus whatever paradox I feel like using.</p>
