<h1>Making a Mage</h1>
<h2>Concept</h2>
<p><em>Describe who your Mage is in five words or so.</em></p>
<p>You may have lived as a mystick most of your life, or you might be a barely woken innocent. What are the fundamental elements of you?</p>
<h2>Avatar</h2>
<p><em>Pick a type <a href="../Setting/Avatars.html">Dynamic, Pattern, Primordial, or Questing</a> and characterize your avatar a bit.</em></p>
<p><em>Avatar 1 costs 0d6, Avatar 2 costs 1d6, 3 costs 2d6, 4 costs 4d6, 5 costs 8d6, 6 costs 16d6</em></p>
<p>Avatar is a mystickal rating of how much personal Quintessence you can hold and how much, from any source, you can spend on a single magickal action.</p>
<h2>Focus</h2>
<p><em>Pick a <a href="../Setting/Focus.html">Paradigm, at least one Magickal practice, and 7 Instruments</a></em></p>
<p>Focus encompasess both your fundamental beliefs about reality, and the nuts and bolts of how you perform magick.</p>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p><em>Assign d6, d8, d10 to the three Attributes: Physical, Mental, Social.</em></p>
<p>Attributes are mundane traits that represent general faculties.</p>
<p>They are the base of most any action.</p>
<h2>Distinctions</h2>
<p><em>Pick a Tradition and 3 more.</em></p>
<p>Distinctions are mundane traits that can help or hinder a Mage's actions. They can be relationships, affiliations, personality, or unique backgrounds.</p>
<p>An appropriate Distinction can be helpful as a d8, or a detriment as a d4 and you get a Plot Point. Helpful or Hurtful is your choice.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p><em>All skills start at 'Untrained' d4. Spend Character Dice to advance them up to 'Master' d12.</em></p>
<p>Skills are mundane traits that represent distinct areas of expertise and training.</p>

<h3>Specialties</h3>
<p><em>Spend a Character Die to add Specialties to a Skill. Each Speciality is a d6.</em></p>
<p>Each skill is intentionally broad. Specialties represent more focused knowledge and training. A Specialty is less likely to be useful, but when it is, you can add an additional d6 to your action pool along with the Skill it specializes.</p>
<h2>Arete</h2>
<p><em>Arete starts at 'Sleep Walker' d4. You may spend Character Dice to increase it up to d12.</em></p>
<p>Arete is a mystick trait that represents your mystick will and enlightenment.</p>
<p>It's the core of your ability to affect reality and is the base trait for any magickal action.</p>
<p>You can spend Quintessence, not Plot Points, to add your Arete trait to a magickal action more than once.</p>
<p>Arete also determined how free you are from the Instruments of your Focus. For every step of Arete above d6, 1 of your required Instruments becomes optional.</p>
<h2>Spheres</h2>
<p><em>Each starts at 'Inexperienced' d4. Spend Character Dice to increase your Spheres. No sphere can be higher then your Arete.</em></p>
<p>The nine Spheres are mystick traits that represent your experience and ability affecting a specific facet of reality.</p>

<h3>Specialties</h3>
<p><em>Spend a Character Die to add Specialties to a Sphere. Each speciality is a d6.</em></p>
<p>Mages may develop specialties in specific aspects of a Sphere. When the specialty applies, you may add an additional d6 to your action pool.</p>
<h2>Backgrounds</h2>
<p><em>A Mage starts with no Backgrounds, but can spend Character Dice to buy them.</em></p>
<p>Backgrounds can be mundane or mystickal and represent extra assets and benefits the character may enjoy.</p>
<p>Many of them are external to the character.</p>
<p>Some Backgrounds can be shared by a cabal meaning each mage contributes one or more traits of whatever size they wish that are then pooled together to represent the various benefits of that background.</p>

Nodes have a Resonance which affects the flavor of their energies and especially the physical form of Tass produced from that Node. A Node can hold at most 1 Quintessence per d6 invested. The Node's Quintessence will regenerate in full each week. Generally a Node's Quintessence will simply wait to be absorbed, but on occasion some amount of it will discharge into a physical form called Tass that can be stored or carried by a Mage, while the unbound Quintessence of the Node regenerates. Mage's skilled in Prime and Matter or Prime and Life can perform workings to coax Quintessence from a Node into Tass and so create a stock pile of magickal energies.</td>
