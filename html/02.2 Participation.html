<p>Joseph kneels in meditation for a some long minutes, perhaps wrestling with the thoughts in his mind until the door of the dojo opens and a gorgeously elegant person bounces through. They toss a melodious apology towards Mifune while removing their coat to reveal a lean frame and plain white gi. “Deepest regrets for my lateness honored sensei! I have no excuse. I gratefully accept any punishment you think fitting.”</p>
<p>Mifune laughs then says, “Line up! Esmerelda, Robert, Patton, Tran. Helen, will you get the wards, please?”</p>
<p>While the rest of the students line up the late comer, Helen, finishes removing their shoes and pops up from the dressing bench to draw the roman shades on either side of the door. Each white shade has the lightest gray glyph of the <a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/whitewolf/images/3/3f/LogoTradAkashicBrotherhood.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20061118002611">Akashayana</a> tradition on the inside face.</p>
<p>The instant the shades are completely drawn the class erupts in a thunderous kiai that reverberates in Joseph’s ears as the dojo transforms around him. Once generic florescent lighting is replaced by glowing paper lanterns hanging from beautiful beams of ancient wood. Instead of spongy athletic mats, he now kneels on soft tatami that fill the dojo with an herbal scent of fresh grass. Even the plain white gi of the others have become varied and colorful.</p>
<p>Helen’s loose blonde hair bounce as they take their place in the line up and Mifune, now in a light blue kimono, stands silently contemplating their stance of attention.</p>
