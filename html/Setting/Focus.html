<h1>Focus</h1>
<p>What does the mage believe? = paradigm</p>
<p>How does the mage turn belief into action? = practice</p>
<p>What does the mage use in that practice? = instruments</p>
<p>All combined = focus</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Practices are the practical part of magick. Beliefs are the power and direction, but a practice is the objects, actions, and patterns. A Practice is the part of magick you can actually show someone and teach to them. Even mages can get tangled up in thinking that their Practice is the most important thing because it's the part they can see.
They break down generally into Technocratic and Mystickal. The technocratic practices fit into the modern world, by design.
On the other hand most of the Mystickal practices seem very out of place, because they are.
By core challenge I mean: Mystickal practices have an uphill battle to fight against reality because they don't fit in. It's hard to believe that just waving a wand and a sword around are enough, so, high ritual magick &quot;works&quot; by requiring very exacting precision and attention to detail. You can maybe think about the core challenge of a practice as the reason why mages who do it believe it works. And it's also an excuse for why a particular working fails. &quot;I didn't pronounce the invocation exactly right.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Paradigms</h2>
<p>Your paradigm is a sweeping elemental belief about the true nature of reality and therefore what Magick is and how it works. Each one has much room for your mage's own specifics and elaborations. Some mages have a strong and clear belief in a single paradigm, others have a less certain blend of several.</p>
<h3>A Mechanistic Cosmos</h3>
<p>Creation is literally a machine, which we can come to understand. Even the lowliest, most chaotic seeming things play some part in the machine.</p>
<p>Magick is an enlightened science of understanding and tinkering with the cosmic machinery.</p>
<h3>A World of Gods and Monsters</h3>
<p>Reality is fundamentally irrational and full of monsters and inhuman powers with unfathomable agendas. We are small creatures trying to survive in this unstable landscape; sometimes fighting and sometimes making monstrous agreements.</p>
<p>Magick is a tool for survival and perhaps even ascending the hierarchy of monsters.</p>
<h3>Bring Back the Golden Age!</h3>
<p>Once upon a time everything was perfect but that was shattered and lost. We fight to restore that state of perfection.</p>
<p>Magick is a connection with the wisdom, ideals, and practices of the Golden Age.</p>
<h3>Creation’s Divine and Alive</h3>
<p>Creation is an ever turning cycle of existence in which life, death, chaos, and order are all essential but transitory states of being.</p>
<p>Magick is understanding the cycles of existence and your place in them as an agent of change.</p>
<h3>Divine Order and Earthly Chaos</h3>
<p>An objective Perfection exists and our reality is a corrupted reflection of it.</p>
<p>The Perfect might be anything from the Divine order of Heaven to the Platonic Ideal.</p>
<p>The corrupting influence might be an active adversary or simply the debased nature of material reality.</p>
<p>Magick is fighting the corrupting influence to achieve understanding and obedience to the Perfect.</p>
<h3>Everything is Chaos</h3>
<p>Reality is indifferent and without purpose. Any perceived order or meaning is created only by your desire for it.</p>
<p>Magick comes from wrangling with cosmic mysteries, but ultimately understanding that it's only your belief which gives them power.</p>
<h3>Everything is Information</h3>
<p>The fundamental nature of reality is non-material; it is Information.</p>
<p>Information might be the Word of God, the code that runs the simulation that is reality, or the vibrational frequencies of creation.</p>
<p>Magick is an understanding of the underlying Information of reality and how to manipulate it.</p>
<h3>Everything’s an Illusion</h3>
<p>The reality we experience is an illusion that conceals a Truth.</p>
<p>That Truth might be a profoundly indifferent Cosmic one, a terrifying horror, or a grotesque joke.</p>
<p>Magick comes from transcending the illusion and grabbing the puppet strings of reality for yourself. Though if your Truth involves entities who created the illusion for a purpose you may have to fight or bargain with them for your power.</p>
<h3>It’s All Good</h3>
<p>Whether consciously or not, all of creation is benevolent and will take of us if we let it. Pain and suffering comes only from our reaction to events.</p>
<p>Magick comes from letting go and letting reality give us it's blessings.</p>
<h3>Might Makes Right</h3>
<p>Reality is a competition without rules or limits where the most ruthless and daring rightfully command the rest.</p>
<p>Magick is the power of your Will and an expression of your exceptionalism.</p>
<h3>One-Way Trip to Oblivion (A modifier for other paradigms)</h3>
<p>Whatever reality is, it's not going to last much longer so make the most of it while you can, or prepare for your elevated position when the new reality comes.</p>
<p>Magick is whatever your paradigm would lead you to believe.</p>
<h3>Tech Holds All Answers</h3>
<p>All of Reality is rational. Everything has a Cause, and with sufficient reason that Cause can be found and understood.</p>
<p>Magick is science that's hard to explain to the untrained.</p>
<h2>Practices</h2>
<p>Paradigm defines what a mage believes Magick is, but their practice defines how they believe magick works.</p>
<p>A mage's practices will be hugely important in play because it frames what kinds of effects they can try and what mundane traits can aid them in their Working.</p>
<p>The arts listed below are only the barest of sketches so there room for personal elaborations and variations.</p>
<h3>Alchemy</h3>
<p>An ancient and demanding art of purifying baseness to reveal perfection.</p>
<p>What most outsiders fail to realize is that much of the alchemist's power to create external effects comes from a painstaking process of internal purification.</p>
<p>Alchemy is not a swift or simple art, but it can create fantastic Wonders, potions and devices.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Skills</strong> - Academics (Enigmas and Codes, Pharmacopeia), Art, Craft, Focus, Occult (Alchemy), Science (Chemistry)</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Books, brews and potions, designs, devices, drugs, formulas, laboratories</p>
<h3>Art of Desire</h3>
<p>This art's deep roots are hidden by its very modern self-help facade. There are many flavors, but ultimately it is the art of manifesting your Will through self-help techniques like positive thinking, visualization, and the law of attraction. To become rich and powerful you must mimic the rich and powerful.</p>
<p>The art of desire is typically focused towards wealth, power, and sex making it a very social art, but it's not uncommon for there to also be a strong strain of personal discipline and physical excellence.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics (culture, philosophy, psychology, economics, politics), Athletics, Etiquette, Influence, Subterfuge.</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Cards and dice, cosmetics, (very refined) dance and gestures, eye contact, fashion, gadgets, mass media, meditation, money and wealth, sex, social domination, vehicles, voice, weapons</p>
<h3>Chaos Magick</h3>
<p>An irreverent practice who's power comes from being non-conformist and iconoclastic. It makes subversive use of whatever it can from pop culture to the dogma of other arts.</p>
<p>A Chaos ritual might involve a pentagram of pop rocks and prayers to the Flying Spaghetti Monster or a heartfelt improvised punk opera.</p>
<p>Chaos magick may sound like an easy practice where anything can work, but it's true power comes from originality and personal physic investment. Imagine a practice that never works the same way twice and demands your entire heart and soul for every effect. That's the real nature of Chaos magick and it's certainly not easy.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Art, Influence, Focus (Lucid Dreaming), Streetwise, Technology</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Whatever works, so long as none of it becomes too stable or confining.</p>
<h3>Craftwork</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most ancient and underestimated of practices, craftwork is the deceptively simple art of making things. One of the most elemental of human magicks is making a tool, and we've made some amazing ones lately.</p>
<p>Craftwork is often looked at with suspicion by Tradition mages because the Technocracy has so exploited the practice to its own ends of mass production and control.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics, Art, Craft, Investigation, Occult (sacred geometry, elemental pacts, stone and metal lore), Science, Survival, Technology</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Artwork, blood, books, computers and IT gear, devices and machines, elements, gadgets, household and crafting tools, laboratories and workshops, symbols, weapons (hammers, blades, sickles, guns, etc.)</p>
<h3>Crazy Wisdom</h3>
<p>This is the path of the Trickster. Such a mage draws power from extreme, contradictory, and taboo breaking behavior. It's disruptive, scary, and often very dangerous.</p>
<p>A Crazy Wisdom working might be an extreme vision quest, an extended orgy, a Saturnalia, letting a dangerous spirit take over your body, facing a dragon, or even a game of truth or dare.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics (Pharmacopeia), Art, Athletics, Influence, Occult, Focus (Lucid Dreaming), Survival</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Blood and body fluids, bones and remains, brain/ computer interface, dance, drugs, music, ordeals, sex and sensuality, social domination, thought forms, toys, tricks and illusions, voice</p>
<h3>Cybernetics</h3>
<p>Drawn from a Greek phrase meaning &quot;to steer or govern&quot; cybernetics is a broad technological art of computerization.</p>
<p>If it can be quantified it can be analyzed, and if it can be analyzed it can be modeled, and if it can be modeled it can be predicted and controlled. All we need are the tools and the data.</p>
<p>Cybernetics includes the merging of man and machine, but also advanced computation, artificial intelligence and data gathering and control.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics (Media, Politics), Craft, Science, Technology (Computers, Biotech)</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Books, brain/ computer interface, computers and IT gear, devices and machines, gadgets, inventions, laboratories, languages, mass media, nanotech, numbers and numerology, weapons, writing and inscriptions</p>
<h3>Dominion / Hypereconomics</h3>
<p>Dominion is the art of command. It derives power from long known techniques for charming, cowing, and tricking other people. The practice of con artists, ad execs, propagandists, seducers, and kings.</p>
<p>Dominion doesn't always imply coercion or manipulation, it is also the art of inspiring people to accomplish more than they thought they could.</p>
<p>Hypereconomics is the art of understanding the desires and values of groups so the power of their collective positive thought can be harnessed and subtly directed.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics (history, psychology, belief systems, media, politics), Art, Influence, Technology</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Art, brain/ computer interface, eye contact, fashion, group rites, languages, mass media, music, social domination, symbols, thought forms, tricks and illusions, voice</p>
<h3>Faith</h3>
<p>Through faith all things are possible. Loyalty, trust, and belief in a higher power is what gives Faith magick its power. But it's the Will of a higher power you are enacting and it might not always be exactly what you want or expect.</p>
<p>A faithful mage may or may not have a social component to their practice, but they definitely have a personal relationship to a higher power which demands acts, sacrifices, and idealistic behavior to maintain.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics (tenets of faith, belief systems), Cosmology, Influence, Medicine</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Blessings and curses, books (scriptures), cups and vessels, energy, food and drink, group rites, music, offerings and sacrifice, ordeals and exertions, prayers and invocations, sacred iconography, symbols, thought forms, voice, writings and inscriptions</p>
<h3>Gutter Magick</h3>
<p>The art of the forgotten, unwanted, and despised. The power of Gutter Magick comes from the squalid, cast off, and abysmal nature of its materials. An ordinary action figure wouldn't do, but a barely recognizable knock-off cast from a shitty mold in the back of a dry cleaners; that's Gutter Magick.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics (area knowledge, Pharmacopeia), Animal Kinship (rats, cats, crows, spiders, snakes, etc.), Art, Craft, Influence, Shoot, Streetwise, Survival (urban), Technology</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Artwork, blood and fluids, bones and remains, cards and dice, dance, drugs and poisons, eye contact, fashion, herbs and plants, household tools, music, offerings and sacrifice, sex, social domination, symbols, thought forms, toys, tricks and illusions, weapons, vehicles</p>
<h3>High Ritual Magick</h3>
<p>What is mostly commonly thought of as magic and wizardry, High Ritual Magick expresses the power of precision to command reality. Every detail is crucial to a working and the details can be ever so exacting; from the exact pitch and volume of an incantation to the correct moon phase under which a dagger was forged by a blind virgin.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics (Belief Systems) Cosmology, Craft, Influence, Investigation, Focus, Occult</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Books, celestial alignments, circles and designs, computers (for modern wizards), cups and vessels, elements, eye contact, fashion, gems, gestures, languages (Latin, Sanskrit, Mandarin, Greek, etc.), meditation, numbers and numerology, offerings and sacrifices, prayer and invocations, social domination, symbols, thought forms, True Names, wands and staves, weapons (swords and knives), writing and inscriptions</p>
<h3>Hypertech</h3>
<p>Any significantly advanced technology will be indistinguishable from magic.</p>
<p>Hypertech is really a catchall practice for advanced technological crafting. It might be energy weapons, or advanced nano-materials.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics, Craft, Investigation, Science, Technology</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Books, brain/ computer interface, computers, devices and machines, household tools, inventions, laboratories, nanotech, writing, and the many tools of technological achievement</p>
<h3>Maleficia</h3>
<p>Any practice can draw extra power from hate, pain, fear, and torture. Maleficia is the practice of dark magick; combining hate and darkness with the inversion of practices that were created to protect and heal.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics (pharmacopeia), Cosmology, Influence (seduction, intimidation, torture), Fight, Occult</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Artwork, blood and fluids, bodywork, bones and remains (often fresh), circles and designs, cups and vessels, curses, elements, eye contact, drugs and poisons, gems and valuables, group rites, music, offerings and sacrifice, prayers and invocations, sex (typically nonconsensual), voice, weapons</p>
<h3>Martial Arts</h3>
<p>Martial arts as mystick practices draw power from the unification of physical discipline, mental focus, and spiritual refinement. Their general theme being the perfection of a human being both inside and out.</p>
<p>That said, some martial disciplines, especially technocratic ones, focus more on the art of war and the science of victory.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics (herbs, history), Athletics, Etiquette, Fight (martial arts, obscure weapons), Focus, Science (Medicine)</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Bodywork, dance and movement, energy, herbs, meditation, ordeals and exertions, symbols, wands and staves, weapons, voice</p>
<h3>Medicine-Work</h3>
<p>Like craftwork, healing is a diverse and ancient practice. Across all the different arts and frameworks the core of any Medicine-Work practice is the <em>duty</em> to heal. The medicine working has a responsibility to find the cause of hurt, whatever that hurt might be, and fix it. It's the sacredness of that duty, which often comes with the associated duty to do no harm, and the strong belief in a particular practice that makes a medicine worker.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics (healing practices, herbalism, energy work, bodywork, healing and meditative practices), Art (masks, dance, music, etc.), Influence, Occult (energy work), Science (medicine), Technology</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Artwork, blessings and curses, blood and fluids, bodywork, bones and remains, books, brews and concoctions, computers, cups and vessels, dance and movement, devices and machines, drugs and poisons, group rites (operations), herbs, laboratories, languages (Latin, jargon, and that weird script doctors use when writing prescriptions), meditation, music, offerings and sacrifices, prayers and invocations, social domination, voice, weapons (surgical instruments)</p>
<h3>Reality Hacking</h3>
<p>Reality is an emergent system that can be exploited. This art invokes the power of the Consensus itself through empowered events, memes, and ideas.</p>
<p>A reality hacker might exploit the general acceptance of movie physics to outrun an explosion, or conversely, forge an entirely new reality through a perfectly timed terrorist attack, or political protest.</p>
<p>Reality hacking is typically more influence than direct effect. Its Workings can be gigantic and sweeping, but never entirely controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Academics (history, philosophy, social sciences, government, media, politics, pop-culture), Art, Influence, Science (psychology as well as physical sciences), Subterfuge, Technology</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Artwork, books, brain/ computer interface, computers and IT gear, devices and machines, drugs, eye contact, group rites, language, mass media, money and wealth, music, nanotech, sex, social domination, symbols, thought forms, tricks and illusions, voice, weapons</p>
<h3>Shamanism</h3>
<p>Shamanism is a calling not a practice. A potential shaman is called by their avatar to undergo a death and resurrection experience before they learn the art of Shamanism.<br>
A true Shaman is a liminal being under constant tension. Not fully part of the material world or the spirit world but rooted in both; this tension often appears to others as schizophrenia.<br>
Most of the shaman's art involves traveling the many layers of the spirit world, interacting with spirit being, and sometimes taking actions to cause effect in the physical.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Art, Cosmology, Influence (expression), Focus (lucid dreaming), Occult (enigmas, spirits), Streetwise, Survival</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Blood and fluids, bones and remains, computers, dance, drugs and concoctions, elements, herbs, household tools, offerings and sacrifice, ordeals, sex and sensuality, thought forms, toys, True Names, voice, weapons</p>
<h3>Voudoun</h3>
<p>Voudoun is a complex art, though rich might be a better word. It's essential roots are slavery, despair, and subversive synthesis of aspects of the tyrant culture. The power of Voudoun is idiosyncratic, but most practitioners believe it comes from extremes of power disparity. Practitioner seeks alliances beyond hope with Loa; for powers that transcend death, enslavement, and the extremity of their condition.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Abilities</strong> - Art, Athletics, Awareness, Belief Systems, Carousing, Crafts, Empathy, Intimidation, Lucid Dreaming, Medicine, Meditation, Streetwise</p>
<p><strong>Common Instruments</strong> - Artwork (vévés), blessings and curses, blood, bones and remains, cards and dice, cups and vessels, crossroads, dance and movement, drugs and poisons, elements, eye contact, fashion, group rites, herbs, household tools, knots and rope, languages, meditation, music, offerings and sacrifices, prayers and invocations, sex and sensuality, symbols, True Names, voice, wands and staves, weapons, writing</p>
