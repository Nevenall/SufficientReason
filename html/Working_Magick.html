<h1 id="working-magick">Working Magick</h1>
<p>Magick is a working of Will and whatever you want can come to pass if your have the power to push it through.</p>
<h2 id="effect">Effect</h2>
<p>Clearly state what you wish to happen and pick the number and size of your Effect Dice. This is your narrative <em>effect</em> and it can what ever and as large as you wish, but the dice you pick for an Effect will be rolled by Reality to resist your working.</p>
<p>If you can define your effect within the context of your magickal <em>practice</em> you'll be able to add dice from your mundane traits and not just your mystickal ones.</p>
<h2 id="spheres">Spheres</h2>
<p>Once your effect is clear we'll break it down into Spheres.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example: You need to cross a gap between two building to escape some technocratic agents. Your <em>Effect</em> is to take a quick herbal concoction to enhance your musculature, making it possible to leap the distance. This clearly invokes your Occult skill and Herbalism specialty. Enhancing your own body requires using the Life Sphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternately: You might calculate the coordinates of the rooftop you wish to be on and run a quick script on your wrist computer to alter your token's position in the virtual reality simulation that is reality; effectively teleporting across the distance. This accomplishes the same goal, but clearly uses Technology and the sphere of Correspondence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once your <em>Effect</em> is clear enough that you can assemble a dice pool for your action, you'll roll and determine a <em>total</em> for reality to attempt to meet or beat with dice based on how radical and complex your <em>Effect</em> is.</p>
<p>If reality's total fails to meet or beat the total for your effect, then your working will succeed. You may generate some Paradox from a successful effect, but if your effect fails you are guaranteed to generate Paradox.</p>
<p>Once you have a clear intent for your Effect break it down into discrete component Spheres and determine the level required from each Sphere.</p>
<p>It is possible for your Effect to have multiple components of the same Sphere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if your magickal attack has a d8 Fire effect and a d8 electricity effect, you have two Forces 3 components. In this case you add your Forces trait once, and reality get 2d8 to resist your working.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="range">Range</h2>
<p>The Range of your Effect will be a Correspondence component. The distance your effect will reach across. [this is a targeting kind of thing]</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>{I have an outstanding question about if scope is a thing. It may very well be a part of the effect die. but it could be a separate thing for you to have to deal with. A d12 effect might be strong but it might also be limited in scope to a single target. If you keep your scope limited to yourself, then reality will generate more opportunities for you to activate. Which is } How large and widespread is your effect?</p>

<h2 id="focused-magick">Focused Magick</h2>
<p>Your focus describes a belief about how reality works and also concrete ways through which you focus the power of your beliefs to shape reality to better fit your belief.</p>
<p>Focused magick is much easier to accomplish because it allows you to enlist dice from mundane traits such as skills and attributes in your working. The drawback is that your <em>Effect</em> is limited by your belief and especially the nature of your practice. If suddenly growing armored skin is not an <em>Effect</em> that fits into your Focus, then it's not a <em>Effect</em> you can accomplish with Focused Magick.</p>

<h2 id="raw-magick">Raw Magick</h2>
<p>Raw magick is an instantaneous working of pure will that transcends all of your beliefs about reality. It is often a desperate Mage's last resort because it is difficult and dangerous.</p>
<p>You can use only your Mystickal traits when working Raw Magick which means fewer dice and a greater chance of failure. On the other hand, the <em>Effect</em> of Raw Magick is not bound by your practice and requires no instruments or preparation.</p>

<p>Once you've rolled to create your effect, Reality will oppose you with a dice pool that's composed based on the effect you are attempting to create.</p>

<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
<p>For Coincidental workings Reality gets 2 dice for it's total.</p>
<p>For Vulgar workings Reality gets 3 dice for it's total and you'll get an extra d6 Paradox regardless of whether your working succeeds or fails.</p>
<p>If you meet or beat reality's total your working is a success. Otherwise, your effect dice gets added to your paradox pool, and perhaps greater retribution if paradox burns off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>some notes to make here. Need to clean up the correspondence and prime vs. just strait up duration traits. So that it's clear how to make an effect. also, need to workout what happens when you target someone. I think this right now: if you target a sleeper, they can't resist with magic. They can maybe resist with mundane traits, based on your effect, but that's it. As a mage you have to beat both reality and their resistance? or maybe not. Maybe you can just blurgh sleepers all you want? if you target someone with magick though, they can add their arete and avatar rating, which now becomes a trait, to reality's dice pool. or maybe just avatar? eitherway, they are harder to effect, and if they detect your working they can work their own countermagick which allows them to roll a full magickal counter? then what? the main issue here is do we add to reality's dice pool, or do we all for a second resistance roll that you must also beat? Either one is possible, but which is easier? if its a second roll, like, someone could still roll to dodge the physical manifestation of your spell? I don't like that. but if we just add to reality's pool...the main thing to ask is how avatar and arete actualyl work. logically, not mechanically. the more you know about how magick works in the SETTING the easier these kinds of questions are to answer. Therefore, as a mage you can resist a working directed at you with your avatar. And various sanctums traits and such for your location. If you are aware of the working and resist it, you can add your arete. If you practice some countermagick based on your correct Counter-magick is page 546 in the m20 book from their perspective, if you successfully create a fireball you still have to hit someone with it. which I am dubious about. thats two rolls for the same thing. and, if your working includes, say, shoot for shooting, then there's no need to make a second attack roll, but...and this is a but, it may be that they can dodge your physical attack if they can see it coming. Which does kinda mean that they get a chance to make a roll to beat your total. just like reality does. eh, there are worse things. be free with information to the players. There's no need to hide things. With Cortex plus it will all even out. which says to me, that you can dodge physical effects maybe, you can also resist magic if you have an avatar and some arete. Avatar is always added. I wonder if you could thus, mundanely resist mind control? that's what willpower was suppose to be for.</p>

<h2 id="ritual-workings">Ritual Workings</h2>
<p>[draft] If two mages have compatible paradigms they can cooperate on a working with a greater chance of success.</p>
<p>For ritual workings, I think you can pool your sphere dice together. And perhaps Arete? Probably. You can pool your Raw magick dice and get greater chance of success, but of course, if there's paradox involved, it will apply to every mage in the working.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Describe the narrative effect you want and decide the Effect dice, Duration, Range, and Scope, then roll your Magick dice pool.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Magick Dice Pool. Arete, the Spheres needed for the effect, and a Casting Time die for how long you take to work the effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Your two highest dice are you total. (Your Effect die comes from your initial choice, not from your dice pool)</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunities you roll can be activated to add/step up your Paradox; or to trigger a backlash complication.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then Reality rolls a reaction against your working using: your Effect dice the level of the Spheres required for the effect, and the Duration, Range and Scope you decided upon.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there are Sleeper witnesses Reality can add a die from d6 to d12 depending on how many there are and how rigid their sense of reality is.</p></li>
<li><p>If your working is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total.</p></li>
<li><p>If your working is Coincidental Reality only gets 2 for it's total and Sleepers can be used as an Asset.</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunities can be activated to trigger a Paradox backlash of your own choice.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If your total meets or beats reality's your effect is successful and you can apply your Effect dice to your targets.</p>
<p>If you fail, your effect dice get added to your Paradox or trigger a backlash that may draw in more of your existing Paradox.</p>
