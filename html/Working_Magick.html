<h1 id="working-magick">Working Magick</h1>
<p>Magick, Will Working, or simply a Working, is a change, any change, in reality you make through an effort of your Enlightened Will. This change is called an <em>Effect</em> and the more clearly you can describe what, and how, you will change reality the better.</p>
<h2 id="effect">Effect</h2>
<p>{maybe transition from effect to feat. Feat especially for the effect die size of things}</p>
<p>Clearly state what you wish to happen and pick your Effect Dice. These may be any number of dice of any size, you may even choose an effect die larger then d12. The larger an Effect Die the grander the effect of your spell.</p>
<p>If you wish to affect more then one target you may choose multiple Effect Dice. Effect Dice may be similar, such as two d8 Fireballs, but they can also be unrelated. For example, d10 life draining and d8 healing for yourself.</p>
<p>You may choose any effect dice you wish, but keep in mind Reality will be rolling these dice to attempt to counter your working.</p>

<h3 id="focused-magick">Focused Magick</h3>
<p>If you can describe how you achieve your <em>effect</em> within the context of your magickal <em>practice</em> you may add dice from your mundane traits, and not just your magickal ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if your practice is witchcraft you might describe collecting some physical token of your victim and creating a poppet with it which you poke with needles. Describing your effect in terms of your practice in this way will allow you to add your Mental, Occult, and your</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="raw-magick">Raw Magick</h3>
<p>Mages occasionally perform their workings with pure will and nothing else. Such Raw Magick transcends your practice and allows you to affect change without needing to follow the patterns and strictures of your practice. It is quicker and simpler, but more dangerous and difficult becuase only your Mystickal traits, usually just Arete and Spheres, can be used.</p>
<h2 id="spheres">Spheres</h2>
<p>Once your effect is clear enough we'll determine how complex it is by determining which Spheres and at which rank it will require.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example: You need to cross a gap between two building to escape some technocratic agents. Your <em>Effect</em> is to take a quick herbal concoction to enhance your musculature, making it possible to leap the distance. This clearly invokes your Occult skill and Herbalism specialty. Enhancing your own body requires using the Life Sphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternately: You might calculate the coordinates of the rooftop you wish to be on and run a quick script on your wrist computer to alter your token's position in the virtual reality simulation that is reality; effectively teleporting across the distance. This accomplishes the same goal, but clearly uses Technology and the sphere of Correspondence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible for your Effect to have multiple components of the same Sphere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if you combine a d8 fire attack with a d8 levitation asset, you are controlling two distinct Forces which requires two d8 Forces components.</p>

<h3 id="targeting">Targeting</h3>
<p>Without extra effort the effects of magick are localized to the mage and their most immediate environment. However, by adding a Correspondence component it is possible to make an effect reach a target or location at any distance. With the addition of Spirit the spell can reach into other worlds as well.</p>
<p>Targeting through Correspondence can be a matter of pure distance, but it can also be a matter of reaching the target though intimate relations. The classic spell upon a lock of their hair is an example of Relational Correspondence from the Practice of Witchcraft.</p>

<p>Magick may have long lasting side-effects, but reality will relentlessly errode the effect itself unless the Mage constantly supports it with Quintessence.</p>
<p>Without support an effect lasts a short while, typically the length of an action. A mage can spend a point of Quintessnce to make an effect endure for the length of a scene. Or mages who have skill in sphere of Prime may tether their effects to the universal energy of creation and make them last longer them a moment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>some notes to make here. Need to clean up the correspondence and prime vs. just strait up duration traits. So that it's clear how to make an effect. also, need to workout what happens when you target someone. I think this right now: if you target a sleeper, they can't resist with magic. They can maybe resist with mundane traits, based on your effect, but that's it. As a mage you have to beat both reality and their resistance? or maybe not. Maybe you can just blurgh sleepers all you want? if you target someone with magick though, they can add their arete and avatar rating, which now becomes a trait, to reality's dice pool. or maybe just avatar? eitherway, they are harder to effect, and if they detect your working they can work their own countermagick which allows them to roll a full magickal counter? then what? the main issue here is do we add to reality's dice pool, or do we all for a second resistance roll that you must also beat? Either one is possible, but which is easier? if its a second roll, like, someone could still roll to dodge the physical manifestation of your spell? I don't like that. but if we just add to reality's pool...the main thing to ask is how avatar and arete actualyl work. logically, not mechanically. the more you know about how magick works in the SETTING the easier these kinds of questions are to answer. Therefore, as a mage you can resist a working directed at you with your avatar. And various sanctums traits and such for your location. If you are aware of the working and resist it, you can add your arete. If you practice some countermagick based on your correct Counter-magick is page 546 in the m20 book from their perspective, if you successfully create a fireball you still have to hit someone with it. which I am dubious about. thats two rolls for the same thing. and, if your working includes, say, shoot for shooting, then there's no need to make a second attack roll, but...and this is a but, it may be that they can dodge your physical attack if they can see it coming. Which does kinda mean that they get a chance to make a roll to beat your total. just like reality does. eh, there are worse things. be free with information to the players. There's no need to hide things. With Cortex plus it will all even out. which says to me, that you can dodge physical effects maybe, you can also resist magic if you have an avatar and some arete. Avatar is always added. I wonder if you could thus, mundanely resist mind control? that's what willpower was suppose to be for.</p>

<h2 id="ritual-workings">Ritual Workings</h2>
<p>[draft] If two mages have compatible paradigms they can cooperate on a working with a greater chance of success.</p>
<p>For ritual workings, I think you can pool your sphere dice together. And perhaps Arete? Probably. You can pool your Raw magick dice and get greater chance of success, but of course, if there's paradox involved, it will apply to every mage in the working.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Describe the narrative effect you want and decide the Effect dice, Duration, Range, and Scope, then roll your Magick dice pool.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Magick Dice Pool. Arete, the Spheres needed for the effect, and a Casting Time die for how long you take to work the effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Your two highest dice are you total. (Your Effect die comes from your initial choice, not from your dice pool)</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunities you roll can be activated to add/step up your Paradox; or to trigger a backlash complication.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then Reality rolls a reaction against your working using: your Effect dice the level of the Spheres required for the effect, and the Duration, Range and Scope you decided upon.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there are Sleeper witnesses Reality can add a die from d6 to d12 depending on how many there are and how rigid their sense of reality is.</p></li>
<li><p>If your working is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it's total.</p></li>
<li><p>If your working is Coincidental Reality only gets 2 for it's total and Sleepers can be used as an Asset.</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunities can be activated to trigger a Paradox backlash of your own choice.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If your total meets or beats reality's your effect is successful and you can apply your Effect dice to your targets.</p>
