<p>The Bag Lady stares at Salazar while fingering a cheap plastic doll pinned to her topmost layer of clothes. Finally she says, &quot;Jeeezus! Coming out of no where like lambs to the slaughter today.&quot; She bows her head and starts rummaging through her cart, muttering to herself &quot;Couldn't give an old hag a heads up could you? No course not. Why would that be a thing? 'Drop the fish on her today,' he said. 'It will be funny,' he said. I'm too old for this shit. 'You can't help <em>them</em>,' he said, 'But <em>these</em> you can, Alba,' says he. Bullshit I can't help <em>them</em>! You know I <em>hate</em> this part. Send when they can wipe their own goddamn asses at least, but noooo. Got to me got to be today of all days.&quot;</p>
<p>At last, the Bag Lady pulls a sheet of uncancelled postage stamps out of her cart and carefully tears off three stamps. She licks one and places it firmly on her forehead underneath a mess of tangly bangs.</p>
<p>She licks the other two and hands them to John and Salazar.</p>
