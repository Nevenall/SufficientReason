<p>Declare what you intend to achieve and how you are going to do it.</p>
<p>If it does not invoke your Will it is a mundane action and the GM will set stakes for your action by rolling dice based on either the traits of the NPC(s) opposing you, or the general difficulty of the action.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the stakes are set you have to meet or beat that total using your mundane traits: Attributes, Distinctions, Skills, mundane Backgrounds, and Assets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can't use mystic traits when performing a mundane action, but you can use assets created through will working.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Successful mundane actions allow you to pick a die to represent your effect. You might use it to inflict stress or a complication. Or, to create an asset you or an ally can use. As usual you can also pay a PP to keep a second effect die.</p>
