<p>As you steps towards the line of students, Mifune gestures for you to stand by his side instead. &quot;This is Joseph Nix. He seeks knowledge of the Way. He has both the Soul and the Will. He is occluded from the mundane, and is on his way to be being an exceptional fighter.&quot; Helen smirks and sizes you up. Their eyes flashing lazily between green and blue. Tran, a Vietnamese man somewhere in his twenties, grimaces in a way that might be a smile and blinks at you. Patton is just barely a teenager with red hair in a bad bowl cut and red cheeks. He stares at you. Robert is a towering, slightly swollen looking dude with grey hair and a porn stache. He watches you impassively with his hands behind his back. Esmerlda the latina Mifune was instructing when you came in rocks back on her heels slightly as you are introduced. Mifune turns to you, &quot;This is a chance to give your life purpose. This is your chance you to join us. What do you say?&quot;</p>
