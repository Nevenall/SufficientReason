<p>how to approach this? maybe from the outside? do they find themselves together or not as they start?</p>
<p>could be an individual discussion Could be salazar gets a little lost.</p>
<p>movie style establishing shot?</p>
<p>I think it would be better to ease into it from salazar's point of view. he's about to get a drop of spirit magick.</p>
<p>Bag Lady is working magick</p>
<p>she's going to give all three of them the ability to see avatars. Seeing avatars is Mind 3/Prime 2/Spirit 1 adding the sharing of that as Life 2.</p>
<p>That's a complex effect.</p>
<p>Alba has: Mental d10 Tradition d8 Occult d10 Arete d12 Mind d8 Prime d6 Spirit d10</p>
<p>[going to remove the casting time because that's more or less dependent on the practice. and it's extra dice we don't need to use. ]</p>
<p>Reality gets: Effect d8 Mind d8 Prime d6 Spirit d4 Duration Prime d8, long enough to have a conversation</p>
<p>Plus whatever paradox I feel like using.</p>
