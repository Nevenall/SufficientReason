<h2 id="san-francisco---modern-day">San Francisco - Modern Day</h2>
<p>A place of history, hills, and high tech. San Francisco is also a battle ground in the Reality War; being an hour’s drive from both the technocratic stronghold of Silicon Valley and the mystick upwelling that is Muir Wood.</p>
<p>The city is full of agents from <em>all</em> sides.</p>
<h3 id="dude">[Dude]</h3>
<p>{Assuming you consent to all this, Ben.}</p>
<p>Seeking good to do in SF, you’ve been doing work with the homeless population and recently you’ve personally experienced an uptick in the number and severity of people with psychotic symptoms.</p>
<p>In fact, you’ve had a close encounter with someone the rest of the rescue staff just call the Bag Lady. She wears a wide brimmed hat and amorphous high collared coat that conceals most of her face. She pushes a shopping cart loaded with bags, but with angel figurines and Christian icons wired all around the outside of the cart.</p>
<p>{Tell us what your encounter with her was like. Why it was scary and especially what unexplainable thing she did.}</p>
<h3 id="salazar">Salazar</h3>
<p>{also assuming this works for you}</p>
<p>You become conscious that you are standing in a park looking at a statue.</p>

<p>{How do you recieve a command/feeling/direction to find someone called the Bag Lady?}</p>
<h2 id="notes-about-the-bag-ladys-response">Notes about the Bag Lady’s response</h2>
<p>So, now the bag lady has some mind powers and wants very much not to be noticed.</p>
<p>She probably thinks that John is a technocratic agent and is trying to scare him off.</p>
<p>What if she was someone who is trying to hide because she was once a technocratic mind researcher? Mind and spirit working together to help people overcome the anxiety of uncertainty.</p>
<p>I like that…</p>
<p>So, we can angle towards the contact. She probably keeps her research notes in her cart. Cambria</p>
<p>She was once a researcher at a technocratic facility. ​She studied Neuro-spirituality her work was important to the local stronghold’s attempt to remove the anxiety of personal uncertainty by removing the spark of someone’s soul.</p>
<p>She had second thoughts when she discovered more about what the plan really was, and she ran and hide with the victims of her research.</p>
<p>she may be trying to help them, though it could also be that she is the technocratic control. she could also be here as an observer. because action and Salazar had made up his ​ about her I believe.</p>
<p>I like that even better. She is a dedicated mind/spirit technocrat. And she has her research notes Ooo… what if she uses her collection of angels as kind of a memory palace storage for her research and for her Watching over the locals.</p>
<p>Alba Camber Her next move is likely to try to make John forget about her. Or even better, to subdue his mind and take him as a potential research subject because she has both spirit and mind and can totally see his avatar which is, I believe, like a 3. Yeah, he’s got a really strong avatar.</p>
<p>A mind d8 working to make j forget, or to read him. She’ll have to use some mundane means because she doesn’t have the mastery to totally take him over. So, do we want the characters to be so immediately subject to a mind mage? Maybe there is some other form of weapon, or a wonder. Actually, a device makes sense. She would have some tranqs because she would need them to bring in subjects for more research. Trained to use them too.</p>
<p>So, how will we work countermagick? Haven’t actually figured that out yet, have ya?</p>
<p>Generally you are working against reality. Which is hard enough. At least for mysticks. If you are aware of a working you could perhaps aid reality if you have the same spheres.</p>
<p>Maybe, if you can detect it and have the same spheres then you can add your applicable sphere traits to the reality pool? What about magick that target’s someone else? That is like, double hard. What kind of reaction do they get? Maybe you</p>
<p>Say you are working to influence someone with mind magick. You roll and reality rolls to counter you. It could be that you have to overcome both reality and the resistance of others. Maybe you can affect sleepers all you want. Maybe they just add a die to reality.</p>
<p>What about targeting other will workers? Maybe they get their arete and their avatar? By default. If they are taking efforts to perform countermagick then they can use some spheres and mundane traits. That makes sense.</p>
<p>So, arete and avatar resist the working in the case of directly targeted spells. That makes reality’s pool pretty darn big. We’ll see how that goes I guess.</p>
<p>So,</p>
