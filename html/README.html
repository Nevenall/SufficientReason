<h1 id="mage---sufficient-reason">Mage - Sufficient Reason</h1>
<p>A play by post Mage campaign using Cortex Plus.</p>
<h2 id="principle-of-sufficient-reason">Principle of Sufficient Reason</h2>
<p>The Principle of Sufficient Reason states &quot;everything must have a cause or reason.&quot;</p>
<p>The name of this campaign comes from the unstated corollary. &quot;All causes can be found and understood by the human mind given sufficient reason.&quot;</p>
<p>The question of whether this corollary holds for all of reality, or not, is intended to be a foundational flavor of the campaign. Not a theme, not necessarily a question to answer, but perhaps, an ever present background color.</p>
