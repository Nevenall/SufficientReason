how to approach this? maybe from the outside? 
do they find themselves together or not as they start?

could be an individual discussion Could be salazar gets a little lost. 


movie style establishing shot?

I think it would be better to ease into it from salazar's point of view. he's about to get a drop of spirit magick. 


Bag Lady is working magick

she's going to give all three of them the ability to see avatars. Seeing avatars is Mind 3/Prime 2/Spirit 1
adding the sharing of that as Life 2. 

That's a complex effect. 

Alba has:
  Mental d10
  Tradition d8
  Occult d10
  Arete d12
  Mind d8
  Prime d6
  Spirit d10
  
  [going to remove the casting time because that's more or less dependent on the practice. and it's extra dice we don't need to use. ]

Reality gets:
  Effect d8
  Mind d8
  Prime d6 
  Spirit d4
  Duration Prime d8, long enough to have a conversation

Plus whatever paradox I feel like using.
