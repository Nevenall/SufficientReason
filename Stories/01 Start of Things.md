## San Francisco - Modern Day 

  A place of history, hills, and high tech. San Francisco is also a battle ground in the Reality War; being an hour's drive from both the technocratic stronghold of Silicon Valley and the mystick upwelling that is Muir Wood.

  The city is full of agents from _all_ sides. 

### \[Dude\]

  {Assuming you consent to all this, Ben.}

  Seeking good to do in SF, you've been doing work with the homeless population and recently you've personally experienced an uptick in the number and severity of people with psychotic symptoms. 

  In fact, you've had a close enounter with someone the rest of the rescue staff just call the Bag Lady. She wears a widebrimmed hat and amorphous high collared coat that conceals most of her face. She pushes a shopping cart loaded with bags, but with angel figurings and christian icons wired all around the outside of the cart. 

  {Tell us what your encounter with her was like. Why it was scary and especially what unexplainable thing she did.} 

### Salazar 

  {also assuming this works for you}

  You become conscious that you are standing in a park looking at a statue.

  {How do you recieve a command/feeling/direction to find someone called the Bag Lady?}
