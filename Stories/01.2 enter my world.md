The Bag Lady stares at Salazar while fingering a cheap plastic doll pinned to her topmost layer of clothes. Finally she says, "Jeeezus! Coming out of no where like lambs to the slaughter today." She bows her head and starts rummaging through her cart, muttering to herself "Couldn't give an old hag a heads up could you? No course not. Why would that be a thing? 'Drop the fish on her today,' he said. 'It will be funny,' he said. I'm too old for this shit. 'You can't help *them*,' he said, 'But *these* you can, Alba,' says he. Bullshit I can't help *them*! You know I *hate* this part. Send when they can wipe their own goddamn asses at least, but noooo. Got to me got to be today of all days."

At last, the Bag Lady pulls a sheet of uncancelled postage stamps out of her cart and carefully tears off three stamps. She licks one and places it firmly on her forehead underneith a mess of tangly bangs.

She licks the other two and hands them to John and Salazar.

"Stick em to your forehead." She says. 

What do you do?
