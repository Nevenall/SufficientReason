some ideas for john's avatar

time and motion study guy
tim ferriss 
maybe some obscure getting things done person
tom robbins, tony robbins the guru guy
maybe a clock
maybe a talking clock
maybe something questy, maybe doctor who. lol
   time and the endless questing to be part of a story. 



what shall we talk about, alba wants to know who these people real are and if they are a threat or what. 


this will actually be a conversation. So, we don't need to do that much to kick things off. Just need a lot of characters and images.
