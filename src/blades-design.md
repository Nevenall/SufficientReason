 # Sufficient Reason

*Everything must have a cause or reason* but are there reasons the human cannot see?

### Mystick Traits

Mages are complex beings and possess a second entire set of traits that mundane sleepers do not. The awakened have Mystick traits which are used to exercise their will against reality. 

#### Arete

the center-piece of the mystick traits is Arete, or Enlightenment according the technomancers. This trait is a measure of a mage's overall awakened will. For magickal actions and resisting mystick paradox you'll roll dice equal to your Arete. 

Arete doesn't advance without difficulty, in fact, this is often the primary pursuit of mages because advancing Arete requires completing a 20-tick downtime clock and performing some variety of seeking. 

Arete is a measure of understanding, not knowledge. The greater your arete rises the more god-like you shall become and the easier it shall be for you to recognize the crutch that is your focus and discard it. 
 
Arete for starting character is 1. 

#### Spheres

These are ratings in the nine facets of reality and they represent your ability to work your will in that facet without invoking paradox. 

Take 1 point in your Affinity Sphere and distribute 5 other points. 

<!-- Not sure we need a start limit for spheres. but if we find we do...No sphere can start greater than 2.  -->

Spheres advance with XP like actions. Take 1 xp when you use a sphere in a desperate action. though only 1 sphere per desperate roll. 

##### Affinity Sphere

Every mage has one sphere that they have a most intimate knowledge of. One sphere that speaks to them more than any other. This is the affinity sphere. Your tradition will give a choice of spheres to choose for this. 

When your working uses your affinity sphere you may take +1 Effect.

### Special Abilities/Advancements
<!-- or do we call them advancements? good for mage -->

#### Avatar

Every mage has a spirit guide which can manifest an appearance to that mage allow. This teacher, guide, torrturer, master, demon, is to some degree responsible for a mage's awakening and also for their connection to the prime enegy 
of reality.
You can take this advancement 1-3 times. Each time you gain an extra quintessence box and your avatar becomes a more powerful presence.  


#### Dreaming/Past Lives

The point is access to knowledge and ability you don't normally have. Like the Rook's Gambit ability you can spend 2 quintessence and add +1D to an action for the duration of scene.

#### Demesne

There is a magical place where you go in your dreams. Unlike most people's though, this is a real place. Somewhere in the Umbral. You might even travel there in corporeal form some day. You have an outsized imporance in this realm, like Dorothy to Oz. 

#### Familiar

Many mage's have a mystickal companion. You may take this advancement upto 3 times. Each time you must sacrifice a permenant box of quintessce to your familiar. For each box given, they can add that many dice to appropriate gather info rolls and they have one box of special armor. When your familiar is close by you may spend their special armor to resist paradox. 

Familiars are independant beings, but you have given them a chunk of your very reality. You share a most intimate bond with them. Can feel what they feel and often share thoughts, even across distances. However, they can be killed, taking their fraction of your being with them.

#### Wonders

Items of signifigance and power. Things that have been crafted and embued.

Mystick abilities powered by quintessence, they are generally faster and safer than ordinary Workings.

Wonders can also be batteries for storing quintessence, and are much prized by mages. 

#### Arcane

A somewhat helpful Weird Arcane is a mystick trait which makes you forgettable. You will fade from memories and even recordings and paper records over time. You may come to wonder if you real exist. It can be hard to get attention when you need it. You don't necessarily control this trait and you fear that one day you will fade away entirely. 


### How Much Quintessence?

this is an important question. the greater the quintessence the longer and stronger you can throw magick around. 

Start with 9 and +1 for each Avatar advancement you take. 

Seems reasonable. 

if a mage has 9 or more quintessence, how much would a vampire, werewolf, or sleeper have? 

#### Running out of Quintessence

What happens? do you suffer some kind of equivelent to trauma, or do you simply lose your ability to resist paradox and power some spells? If you are good at prime you can recharge yourself, though it has to come from somewhere. I think that's the way it should work. your quintessence rating is your extra, if you run out you are just out, 

but if you are desperate you can start eating the reality of your own pattern to fuel your magick. Take mystick harm to your very being and you get an equivelent amount of quintessence to spend. 

most moving of quintessence is coincidental, but can become vulgar if it's more than 3. 


## Chantry/Cabal

Are the PCs small parts of a larger Chanty or are they their own small Chantry trying to make their own way? 
this has a big effect on what kind of game we play. 

I can see the first option making a lot of sense but I think it might be the less interesting option. Isn't it more interesting if the characters are their own chantry with their own node and resources, working for their own goals? Of course, there are lots of others that you can interact with, still maintain relationships with, get help from. Maybe even still be a member of. Nothing says you can't be welcome in larger chantries, in fact, for important meetings and such, you would go to your faction's major chantry. 

The PC group (cabal?) may or my not have their own chantry with a node and everything. They might just have a "place" where they meet. Cabal is the work M20 uses. 

cabal being the equivalent of gang. 
Sufficient Reason is less about the cabal fighting for territory and status and doing scores together though. It's about very different things, which makes me wonder if the cabal should have a playbook of its own? 
if it did it would have useful things on it, like nodes and libraries and sphere training grounds. 
but it might be interesting if acquiring things like that was more of a downtime action. Meaning that a mage would have to set aside his quest for greater understanding of reality and Will advancement to gather a library or tap a node. that could be an interesting challenge. 

the mechanics of that are saying that Sufficient Reason is about all the things that can get in the way of a Mage's dedication to advancing his power in the form of Will. 
at least a fair bit of the game is about that. Kind of harkens to Ars Magica. 
Nothing wrong with that, but good to recognize. 

### Drawing Together

One of the more important things to record is how you all came together. Especially if you are from different traditions. and maybe what keeps you together? and are their other lesser mages in your chantry? that's an interesting question. Or even mundanes? Your chantry could be a homeless shelter that you have only occasional access to. 

## Recovery

### Stress

Stress recovery comes from your relationships and things that connect you to the mundane world. Mundane people are important. 

Stress recovery can be things like parties, conversations, debates, sex. Karaoke. 
Something that involves sleepers. Stress is a human quality and you may be a supermage, but you are still somewhat human. 

Like blades, you roll your weakest attribute to see how much stress you recover. If you recover more than you lack, there is some kind of complication from your activities. Accidentally revealing some magely powers or otherwise catching unwelcome attention. 

### Quintessence

Quintessence recovery requires time at a node and some kind of private activity. Often something creative, occassionally something more active like a dance party. Regardless, a node is required. To recover quintessence you roll your Arete and maybe get a +1 for every avatar advancement you have. There are no complications from overdoing it. 

## Shape of the Game

Mages don't do scores, but they do have lots of free-play life events. 

What actually separates downtime for a mage from free play though?
that is a very important question. 

Maybe some kind of unavoidable inciting event? hard to engineer all the time, but.. that is a start. 
there is something happening in your life that draws you away from your downtime activities. 

doesn't have to be a huge thing, could be really mundane like the death of a family member or a request from a friend. Could be arranged between two PCs too. Maybe one is bored and comes visiting? 

Seems like there is no equivalent of a score. there may be action sequences that are similar, and a cabal might decide to do a thing together, maybe take action together to advance their chantry even. Like setup a node. 
 
interesting, I like a lot of this. 

## Magick

We'll call the thing you are doing a Working to differentiate it from effect. because effect for blades is more like successes. 

### Magick Action

- Roll Arete
- Insufficient Spheres incurs automatic paradox sized to your deficit
- resist paradox with Arete for mystick consequences or an attribute for paradox that is mundane
- position is set based mostly on coincidental vs. vulgar. The more vulgar the greater the consequences for failing
- Effect: for the most part the number of successes required translates to the level of effect needed for the Working

#### Position, Focus, and Locality

The primary consideration for setting position is coincidental vs. vulgar but there are sometimes another axis to look at. 

One is focus; is your working easily part of your focus and are you taking your time to perform it according to the constraints of your focus? or are you cutting corners and trying something that can't be clearly placed in your focus? 

Another aspect is locality; workings deeply related to your focus are easier and performing in localities closely related your focus, (ie sanctums or resonant locations) are even more likely to be coincidental rather then vulgar. 

Oh the other hand perform your working without paying proper attention to the requirements of your focus, or even performing raw magick without the support of any focus at all, this is more likely to be desperate than controlled. 

### Spheres

Rank 1: Perception - the ability to perceive and observe the forces in question. With such basic (yet useful) understanding, a character can sense things that few mortals ever recognize. 

Rank 2: Manipulation - the ability to do small things with those forces. At this point, the mage begins to exert minor control over the phenomena she sees, and may use it to work small changes upon herself.

Rank 3: Control - the ability to alter reality in noticeable ways, though these are usually restricted to the mage's self. In most cases, the Sphere begins inflicting damage at this level, and allows the character to work small alterations on other characters. 

Rank 4: Command - the ability to perform major acts of alteration through the principles of that Sphere. Generally, this level allows the mage to make significant changes to the Patterns of other characters. 

Rank 5: Mastery - the ability to command vast forces in connection with that element of reality. By now, the mage knows almost everything there is to know about the principles of that Sphere and can perform godlike deeds with them. 

### Paradox

In Sufficient Reason, paradox is a whole new kind of harm and consequence you get to experience. 

Paradox can happen when you attempt magick beyond the scope of your current sphere ratings. It can also happen as the result of magick actions which score a 4/5 or less. 

Mechanically speaking, Paradox is actually a general term for consequences  from Magickal actions. They can be mystickal, (witches spoiling the milk, for example) and be resisted with Will, but they can also be very real consequences like explosions and crumbling buildings which can also be resisted using the mundane attributes.

Paradox can result in various forms of mystickal harm such as weirds and quiets. Auras of strangeness around the mage, or "delusions" that separate them from the mundane world. 


Paradox is reality defending itself from being ripped apart and changed. That's why spheres are important. They represent your ability to make changes in a particular area without incurring the wrath of the consensus. 

Simple enough.
