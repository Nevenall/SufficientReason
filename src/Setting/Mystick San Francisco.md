### [tbd] Dojo

A chantry of agressive Akasshyana lead by [Mifune](Characters/Mifune.md)

### The New Celestial Alignment Chantry

Based in Marin County they are a powerful alliance of hermetic and some choristers/verbena which formed in the 60s and still ruled by those really 60s mages. 
They have wealth and power and the Muir Woods node. Which is a fuck of a powerful node to control. 
How do they maintain it? 
What do they do with that quintessence? 
Build up power and stuff

### Alba and the city under chantry [Undercity Chantry?]

they are a kinda random collection of misfits who have hidden network of underground/secret passages throughout the city. Like the steps behind the Fisherman's Wharf hostel.
They are an anarcho-syncladic commune where each mage tries to make a difference in a way that makes sense to them. They do sometimes work together though
