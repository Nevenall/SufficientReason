### [tbd] Dojo/fight club? [Tier II]

A chantry of agressive Akasshyana lead by [Mifune](Characters/Mifune.md)

Maybe the dojo is a front, the fight club is what its really about. 

Mifune is a tradtion warrior and he is serious about fighting the technocrats and in training/indoctrinating others to do so. 
He's building a small army to attack large technocratic strongholds. 

### The New Celestial Alignment [Tier V]

Based in Marin County they are a powerful alliance of Gaia flavored Choristers, Verbena, and a few Hermetics which formed in the 60s. 

They have wealth and power and control the Muir Woods node. Which is a fuck of a powerful node. 

Outstanding questions: who are the mages of this chantry and what is their goal?

Mostly they try to maintain order in the bay area, and further areas. They have a vested interest in keeping things calm. They also make a lot of money from the concentrated technocracy endevors here. Which is something other mages give them grief for. 

### Undercity [Tier III]

A diverse collection of willworkers, but especially misfits, orphans, and mages with paradox that complicates normal social interaction. 

Undercity is sort of an anarcho-syncladic commune where each mage tries to make a difference in a way that makes sense to them. They share information and protection. 

[Alba Caduca](Characters/Alba%20Caduca.md) is one of the elders of the chantry.

Territorially, they control a network of concealed areas under the city which includes several small nodes and localities. 

Undercity is a lot larger then most mages know. Given it's decentralized nature, its probably a lot larger than even Alba knows.

### Darkhouse [Tier II]

A chantry of mages who enjoy meeting in a classic victorian house painted entirely black. 

They don't have a strong direction. The mages of Darkhouse mostly persue their own personal agendas and dabble in gothy magick.
