# Sufficient Reason

*Everything must have a cause or reason* but there is an unstated assumption these reasons are sufficient to explain an event and will be conprehensible to a human mind.

## Making a Mage

### Special Abilities

Avatar – can take it once maybe even twice. Your avatar can casually manifest to others, not just you. And you have 2 additional quintessence boxes. 

Dreaming/Past Lives – The point is access to knowledge and ability you don't normally have

Demesne – There is a magical place where you go in your dreams. 

Familiar - a companion. Can help you with knowledge skills, and armor against paradox, sacrifice one quintessence box. It can't be killed by mundane means because it's a part of your being. It will reform after a while. Or will it? that might be too dnd. 

Wonders - these can be all kinds of things. 

Arcane - almost a weird in someways, arcane makes you forgettable. You will fade from memories and recordings and sometimes it is hard to get attention when you need it. You don't necessarily control this, and you fear that oneday you'll wake up and no one will remember you. 

## Shape of the Game

Mages don't do scores, but they do have lots of free-play life events. 

What actually separates downtime for a mage from free play though?
that is a very important question. 

Maybe some kind of unavoidable inciting event? hard to engineer all the time, but.. that is a start. 
there is something happening in your life that draws you away from your downtime activities. 

doesn't have to be a huge thing, could be really mundane like the death of a family member or a request from a friend. Could be arranged between two PCs too. Maybe one is bored and comes visiting? 

Seems like there is no equivalent of a score. there may be action sequences that are similar, and a cabal might decide to do a thing together, maybe take action together to advance their chantry even. Like setup a node. 
 
interesting, I like a lot of this. And mages have real lifes
