# Mage - Sufficient Reason

A play by post Mage campaign using Cortex Prime.

## Principle of Sufficient Reason

The Principle of Sufficient Reason states "everything must have a cause or reason."

The name of this campaign comes from the unstated corollary. "All causes can be found and understood by the human mind given sufficient reason."

The question of whether this corollary holds for all of reality, or not, is intended to be a foundational flavor of the campaign. Not a theme, not necessarily a question to answer, but perhaps, an ever present background color.
